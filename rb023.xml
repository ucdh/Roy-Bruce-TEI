                Really I am ashamed of the 
                <lb/>
                skimpy letters I send you when I read your
                <lb/>
                very interesting epistles. Here am I surrounded
                <lb/>
                with some of the most interesting historical
                <lb/>
                spots in the world and for the life of me
                <lb/>
                I cannot describe them on paper. It is a
                <lb/>
                great pity for you, because you would simply
                <lb/>
                revel in all this.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                All that I have read &amp; heard
                <lb/>
                about the charm of the desert so far I
                <lb/>
                must admit I have not experienced.I
                <lb/>
                can however well understand that it would
                <lb/>
                be very fascinating for some people, like
                <lb/>
                mountains or the seas are for others.
                <lb/>
                Personally I cannot find romance in
                <lb/>
                dust and when one lives in dust,
                <lb/>
                dust in everything, food, clothes, etc for weeks

                at a time one longs for a little mud.
                <lb/>
                But this winter is superb. sunshine

                all day long, there has not been more than
                <lb/>
                3 points of rain since we arrived &amp; only one

                Last Sunday afternoon  <name type="person" ref="#PIN">Pinkie</name> &amp; I went
                <lb/>
                to see his cousin.  They have a very nice
                <lb/>
                house at <name type="place" ref="#GZI" key="GZI">Gezirah</name> a suburb of <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> principally
                <lb/>
                devoted to the English colony.  Very pretty streets
                <lb/>
                with trees along them &amp; lovely gardens-  It
                <lb/>
                was so nice to get into a civilised house
                <lb/>
                again and to have afternoon tea a l'Anglaise
                <lb/>
                once more- They are both very nice &amp; there
                <lb/>
                are three dear little children.  Two girls &amp; a
                <lb/>
                boy, the youngest girl about 3 years old I think
                <lb/>
                with intervals of about 2/3 years between the
                <lb/>
                others-  We are going there to dine on
                <lb/>
                Sunday.  Everyone dines here at 8 o'clock &amp;
                <lb/>
                no music halls or anything except continuous
                <lb/>
                picture shows start before 9:30. Supper
                <lb/>
                restaurants remain open till 2a.m. &amp;
                <lb/>
                are usually full between 12.30 &amp; that hour.
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> reminds me a little of <name type="place" ref="#PAR" key="PAR">Paris</name> except

                that it is more so is you know what
                <lb/>
                I mean. I like sitting on the balcony of

                morning crowds that wander by. Perhaps in
                <lb/>
                half an hour one can see every nationality
                <lb/>
                excepting German at the present time.
                <lb/>

                hawkers selling bread, wine in goat skins,
                <lb/>
                walking sticks, lottery tickets, newspapers,
                <lb/>
                postage stamps (mostly forgeries) beads, jewellery,
                <lb/>
                cigarettes, shawls, carpets, handkerchiefs, scent,
                <lb/>
                soap in fact almost anything can be
                <lb/>
                bought from these hawkers, who are all dirty,
                <lb/>
                dressed in Arabian costumes, all shades of colour
                <lb/>
                from the almost ebony Nubian &amp; Soudance to
                <lb/>
                the almost yellow Egyptians- They are all
                <lb/>
                rogues, but at first picturesque till one gets
                <lb/>
                tired of their importunities- I forgot to add
                <lb/>
                beggars, &amp; in some cases more pitiful sights
                <lb/>
                are hard to imagine. Doubtless some are
                <lb/>
                genuine, their principal appeal for alms is
                <lb/>
                either a deformity or a disease or a child of

                about 12 carrying a baby which may or may
                <lb/>
                not be hers- I was almost forgetting the
                <lb/>
                boot blacks, small boys, clad in a single 
                <lb/>
                garment who run in &amp; out amongst the

                peoples legs with their blacking kits urging you
                <lb/>
                to get your boots cleane for 1/2 piastre (1 1/4).
                <lb/>
                So much for the pavements- Natives on donkeys.
                <lb/>
                Europeans on bicycles. a hawker with a barrow,

                <lb/>
                driven by natives, with usually two lean arab

                horses, who go all day under the whip &amp; never
                <lb/>
                seem to tire. The cabs are all victorias- There
                <lb/>
                is no speed limit in <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> &amp; the shouting that
                <lb/>
                goes on is quite amusing- Virtue and vice,

                riches &amp; poverty are here in greater contrast
                <lb/>
                than in any place I have yet visited. You
                <lb/>
                would enjoy it, but everything is very expensive,
                <lb/>
                and unless one is very wide awake one is

                from outside eyes. I should much like to

                Truly it is the way to live, and nothing

                would be wanting if you were to share

                There are rumours going around of a

                getting a little stale here now and the men
                <lb/>
                are very tired of the forced in action, consequently
                <lb/>
                discipline is to a slight extent suffering.

                This morning we had a powpow with

                the General, and he told us that it would

                we were absolutely fit and he was glad to say
                <lb/>
                the time was fast approaching when we would     
                <lb/>
                be fit.   That means Europe about the beginning

                photographs which I think you will find

                &amp; it was taken from a little gallery on top

                From what we can gather from notes

                sent to us from <name type="place" ref="#EUR" key="EUR">Europe</name>, all the fighting is

                &amp; stay there for a few days &amp; then go back
                <lb/>

                always more soldiers. He hopes to be able to pick

                expensive that until we get into the field
                <lb/>
                and far away from standing camps. I am
                <lb/>
                afraid it will not be possible.
                <lb/>
                Your story of <name type="person" ref="#CRA">Craigie</name> &amp; the combinations
                <lb/>
                was lovely. I wish I could make my
                <lb/>
                letters more amusing but I never seem to
                <lb/>
                be able to write down anything funny
            </p>
            <p>
                Tell <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name> she is not to expect letters
                <lb/>
                from me every time I write to you, but
                <lb/>
                I will write to her as often as I can-
                <lb/>
                If I write to her every time &amp; then perhaps
                <lb/>
                am forced to miss a few times it will
                <lb/>
                make it much harder for her later on- Now
                <lb/>
                they will always be a surprise. I am
                <lb/>
                sending one this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Goodbye for the present, dearest of wives.
                <lb/>
                perhaps next time I write we shall have
                <lb/>
                some definite news of <unclear></unclear>
