            Another week has gone by
            <lb/>
            &amp; still we are here; but the signs in the air
            <lb/>
            of a move are even more portentious.  Where it
            <lb/>
            will be to I do not know, but still i am
            <lb/>
            in favour of <name type="place" ref="#EUR" key="EUR">Europe</name>.  Of course we may go by
            <lb/>
            sea to <name type="place" ref="#PAL" key="PAL">Palestine</name> &amp; push in behind the Turks, who
            <lb/>
            by the way seem to have had about enough of
            <lb/>
            the canal, for the time being at any rate.  We
            <lb/>
            get practically no news of what is going on
            <lb/>
            there.  We have heard indirectly that an officer
            <lb/>
            of the <name type="organisation" ref="#NLI">Nelson Infantry</name> distinguished himself, but
            <lb/>
            do not know any particulars.  I think the
            <lb/>
            beginning of March will see us well on the
            <lb/>
            way to <name type="place" ref="#EUR" key="EUR">Europe</name>.  I do hope so, every man is
            <lb/>
            now keep to do the little task allotted to him,
            <lb/>
            and I have no fear that they will not acquit
            <lb/>
            themselves reasonably well.
        </p>        
        <p>I am going to send you a list of the men
            <lb/>
            in my troop so that when you see any
            <lb/>
            casualty lists you will know whether they
            <lb/>
            belong to me or not.            
        </p>
        <p>
            <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> &amp; I went on the spree yesterday.
            <lb/>
            We broke loose in the afternoon and thoroughly
            
            <pb n="2" facs="#rb025b" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
            
            enjoyed ourselves till about 3 o'clock in the
            <lb/>
            morning.  We seem to have more than ever
            <lb/>
            in common now, I only wish he was with 
            <lb/>
            us.  Did I tell you that he had been attached
            <lb/>
            to the Army Service Corps so I don't suppose we
            <lb/>
            shall see much of each other after we leave
            <lb/>
            here.  His new billet will give scope for
            <lb/>
            his organising &amp; administrative powers, but at
            <lb/>
            the same time I think the force has lost
            <lb/>
            a good combatant officer.            
        </p>
        <p>
            We went &amp; visited a few mosques in
            <lb/>
            the afternoon, they are all much about the
            <lb/>
            same, took a drive through the old slave
            <lb/>
            market, which is a little dirtier than the 
            <lb/>
            rest of the Arab quarter, and after tea at
            <lb/>
            <name type="place">Shepheard's</name> had a little dinner at <name type="place" ref="#SAU" key="SAU">Sault's</name>, a
            <lb/>
            <choice><sic>french</sic><corr>French</corr></choice> restaurant which I think I have
            <lb/>
            mentioned before.  After dinner we went to the 
            <lb/>
            Kursaal (music hall) &amp; saw several very good
            <lb/>
            tunes &amp; enjoyed our coffee &amp; liqueurs, and about
            <lb/>
            11 o'clock went round to the Cas<del rend="strike">o</del><add place="above">i</add>no de Paris -
            <lb/>
            the Casino, a sort of Moulin Rouge, dancing hall,
            <lb/>
            music hall, café chaulant etc, is rather unique
            
            <pb n="3" facs="#rb025c" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb1"/>
            
            in its way as it is reserved for officers only <add place="above">&amp; civilians</add>.
            <lb/>
            One smokes, &amp; drinks &amp; dances with the
            <lb/>
            various ladies who go there and one generally
            <lb/>
            has a gay &amp; giddy time which ends sometimes
            <lb/>
            in one way &amp; sometimes in another.  The
            <lb/>
            main drawback is that it is very expensive - 
            <lb/>
            but at the same time it is very amusing
            <lb/>
            &amp; if one goes there with an open mind &amp; pocket,
            <lb/>
            it will certainly chase away any blues.  Of the 
            <lb/>
            ladies who frequent the place - well - some
            <lb/>
            are extremely handsome some beautiful some 
            <lb/>
            less so, but nearly all attractive &amp; of all
            <lb/>
            nationalities except German now.  French
            <lb/>
            predominate, Russian, American, Roumanian,
            <lb/>
            Greek, English, indeed a man would be hard
            <lb/>
            to please if he could not find one amongst them
            <lb/>
            to suit his taste.  We stayed there amusing
            <lb/>
            ourselves till 2.30 &amp; then after a little supper
            <lb/>
            came home.  I happen to number several of
            <lb/>
            these ladies among my acquaintances, principally
            <lb/>
            owing to having acted as guide, philosopher etc
            <lb/>
            to our young friend, and perhaps because I
            <lb/>
            speak French &amp; perhaps because I do not
            <lb/>
            treat them any differently from other women,
            <lb/>
            I get all kinds of information &amp; ideas of
            <lb/>
            interest from them. I shall have some 
            <lb/>
            lovely stories for you when I get back.
            
            <pb n="4" facs="#rb025d" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb2"/>
            
            One of the best is this - A certain young
            <lb/>
            officer of our acquaintance, who must be
            <lb/>
            nameless, but you will have guessed at 
            <lb/>
            the end of the story; being in a similar
            <lb/>
            plight to the Carmelite friar, betook himself
            <lb/>
            unto the Casi<del rend="strike">o</del><add place="above">i</add>no one evening &amp; there finding
            <lb/>
            his heart's desire returned 'chez elle' which
            <lb/>
            means 'took her home'.  For some reason
            <lb/>
            or other they forgot to set the alarm &amp; they
            <lb/>
            both went to sleep.  Imagine the horror of
            <lb/>
            our hero to wake up at 5 o'clock, six miles 
            <lb/>
            from camp &amp; reveille at 5.30 &amp; no cab
            <lb/>
            ordered.  He tore into his clothes rushed down
            <lb/>
            stairs into the street, left one spur &amp; his
            <lb/>
            identity disc behind him, looked wildly 
            <lb/>
            round for a cab (it is dark at 5 o'clock
            <lb/>
            here now) could only see an Arab sleeping
            <lb/>
            beside a donkey, grabbed the donkey &amp; with
            <lb/>
            one spur working furiously galloped up
            <lb/>
            the <name type="place" ref="#ABO" key="ABO">Avenue Boulac</name> (one of the main streets 
            <lb/>
            of <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>) at 5.15 am with a shrieking
            <lb/>
            dragoman after him.  He found a taxi
            <lb/>
            at the Continental Hotel &amp; got to camp
            <lb/>
            just in time. - I saw his friend last
            
            <pb n="5" facs="#rb025e" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb3"/>
            
            night &amp; she said to me "Do tell me,
            <lb/>
            did the "le petit Anglais" (he is always
            <lb/>
            the "little English one") get back in time,
            <lb/>
            do you know I have been so worried
            <lb/>
            about him, I cannot think why I went
            <lb/>
            to sleep like that". I reassured her that
            <lb/>
            all was well.       
        </p>
        <p>
            I would have given a lot to have seen
            <lb/>
            that early morning training gallop in the 
            <lb/>
            <name type="place" ref="#ABO" key="ABO">Boulac</name>.       
        </p>
        <p>
            I often wonder here what our pious
            <lb/>
            friends in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name> would say if they
            <lb/>
            could see the pillars of their native villages,
            <lb/>
            because old &amp; young go to the Casino, dancing
            <lb/>
            the two step &amp; taking these too attractive
            <lb/>
            girls to supper at 1 am etc. etc.        
        </p>
        <p>
            I have had more fun out of our
            <lb/>
            sojourn here than I deemed possible.  It doesn't
            <lb/>
            affect me, I have seen it all before, but most
            <lb/>
            of these other birds have not and sometimes
            <lb/>
            it is too funny for words.  The limit to
            <lb/>
            my chuckling was reached the other night,
            <lb/>
            when a subaltern of the reinforcements, finding
            <lb/>
            himself rather stuck for want of knowledge 
            <lb/>
            of French, asked me if I would make
            <lb/>
            arrangements, bargain etc for him.  With unholy
            <lb/>
            joy I consented &amp; by Jove I made him pay
            
            <pb n="6" facs="#rb025f" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
            
            for it too.        
        </p>
        <p>
            By all this you will gather that I
            <lb/>
            am enjoying life well. Health, work &amp; play
            <lb/>
            combine to make a contented whole, with 
            <lb/>
            two flies in the ointment. The first fly 
            <lb/>
            that you are not here with me to share 
            <lb/>
            it all.  The second fly, that if I ever
            <lb/>
            have to return to civilian life it will
            <lb/>
            just about finish me.  This is without
            <lb/>
            a doubt the only possible life to live, I 
            <lb/>
            mean the army, not <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>.  I am so
            <lb/>
            afraid that after the war there will be so
            <lb/>
            many looking for appointments and as
            <lb/>
            usual influence will carry the day.
            <lb/>
            However it is no use worrying now &amp; I
            <lb/>
            must be thankful that I am allowed to 
            <lb/>
            spend even a portion of my life at the game
            <lb/>
            I am learning to love so well.        
        </p>
        <p>
            None of the parcels you have sent
            <lb/>
            have yet arrived - please dear do not spend
            <lb/>
            your money sending me things. I am

            well supplied, here, at all events, I only
            <lb/>
            wish I could send you some of the lovely
