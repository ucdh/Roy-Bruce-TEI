      <p>
        We are still here. I am
        <lb/>
        sorry I missed last mail but I have
        <lb/>
        been suffering from what is locally called
        <lb/>
        a "Gyppy tummy" in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z</name> it is called "gripes".
        <lb/>
        It is not realy quite the same though, as
        <lb/>
        this is probably caused by heat, sand &amp; flies.
        <lb/>
        It is rather a nuisance though &amp; somewhat
        <lb/>
        painful, incidentally it cost me a pair of
        <lb/>
        pyjamas without any warning the other
        <lb/>
        morning, which is also a painful subject,
        <lb/>
        it was particularly painful to my orderly
        <lb/>
        who had to dig a grave! But really I am
        <lb/>
        nearly well now, I have been threatened
        <lb/>
        with the hospital by <name type="person">Thomas</name> &amp; <name type="person" ref="#GUN">Gunthrie</name> &amp; have
        <lb/>
        promised to be a good boy &amp; go if I am not
        <lb/>
        better by tomorrow, but I shall be alright
        <lb/>
        tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are hung up here I believe
        <lb/>
        waiting for the <name type="place" ref="#DAN" key="DAN">Dardanelles</name> to be forced, as soon
        <lb/>
        as that happens we move. English, Indian,

        Colonial &amp; also 20,000 French troops which have
        <lb/>
        just arrived at <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>. The whole of this
        <lb/>
        force forms another army under <name type="person" ref="#IHA" key="IHA">General Sir Ian<lb/> Hamilton</name>
        , who has just arrived &amp; inspects us on

        <lb/>
        take <name type="place" ref="#CON" key="CON">Constantinople</name> &amp; then possibly with the
        <lb/>
        Italians &amp; some other states drive right up
        <lb/>
        north a into <name type="place" ref="#AST" key="AST">Austria</name> &amp; eventually <name type="place" ref="#GER" key="GER">Germany</name>.
        <lb/>
        This will force <name type="place" ref="#GER" key="GER">Germany</name> to withdraw troops from
        <lb/>
        both Eastern &amp; Western frontiers &amp; will probably
        <lb/>
        end by converging on <name type="place" ref="#BER" key="BER">Berlin</name> if they don't give
        <lb/>
        in before. Of course none of this is official,
        <lb/>
        but it is the conclusion I have come to by
        <lb/>
        putting two &amp; two together. Also it is sound
        <lb/>
        tactics although on a rather large scale.        
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be splendid to be under <name type="person" ref="#IHA" key="IHA">Genenral <lb/>Hamilton</name>
        , especially as he has already had so much
        <lb/>
        to do with Colonial troops.

      <p>
        We had a big inspection &amp; march
        <lb/>
        past the other day by <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>'s new <name type="person" ref="#HMM" key="HMM">High Com<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="u">snr</hi></hi></name>
        <lb/>
        &amp; <name type="person" ref="#MAX" key="MAX">General Maxwell</name>, really the culminating
        <lb/>
        point of our training. First of all we all
        <lb/>
        walked by quickly &amp; afterwards the <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name>
        <lb/>
        &amp; Australian cavalry (the call us cavalry now)
        <lb/>
        cantered past the saluting base. I saw the
        <lb/>
        picture man at work but I don't know whether
        <lb/>
        they will get to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name> If they do &amp; you can
        
        <pb n="3" facs="#rb029c" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb1"/>
        
        pick old <name type="person" ref="#WAI">Wain</name>'s white moustache. I was
        <lb/>
        riding just a length behind him. I
        <lb/>
        believe the whole show was very good.
        <lb/>
        Everyone was pleased &amp; we spent the
        <lb/>
        afternoon back-scratching. Since then
        <lb/>
        we have done very little work, that is
        <lb/>
        hard work in the field, so we take it our
        <lb/>
        training is complete and we are ready
        <lb/>
        for nything that may come along.
         </p>
      <p>
        It is getting very warm here
        <lb/>
        now in the middle of the day &amp; the 
        <lb/>
        afternoons, too much so for our thick
        <lb/>
        uniforms; the dust storms also are getting
        <lb/>
        more violent &amp; more frequent, I used
        <lb/>
        to think nor.westers were bad, but they
        <lb/>
        are gentle zephyrs compared to these.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I can see in the
        <lb/>
        papers you send me you can get far
        <lb/>
        more news of our doings &amp; what <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> is
        <lb/>
        like from the "Weekly Press" than anything
        <lb/>
        I can tell you. Why even I learn
        <lb/>
        things about our doings from the
        <lb/>
        "Weekly Press" that I didn't know before.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had a splendid three day
        
        <pb n="4" facs="#rb029d" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
        
        trip a little while ago to the <name type="place" ref="#DBR" key="DBR">Delta Barrage</name>.
        <lb/>
        The <name type="place" ref="#DBR" key="DBR">Delta Barrage</name> is a huge dam on the
        <lb/>
        <name type="place" ref="#NIL" key="NIL">Nile</name> &amp; controls all the irrigation of Lower
        <lb/>
        <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>. It only cost 6 million to build,
        <lb/>
        so you can imagine it is something rather
        <lb/>
        wonderful. There are the most glorious
        <lb/>
        gardens &amp; terraced walks there, we were
        <lb/>
        all just like kinds in the fresh grass &amp; to
        <lb/>
        hear running water again was like music.
        <lb/>
        We took the squadron down &amp; practised
        <lb/>
        swiming horses across the river. We had
        <lb/>
        a good time and it was very successful.
        <lb/>
        Met the engineer there a man named
        <lb/>
        Max, a Scotchman, who took us home to
        <lb/>
        dinner &amp; fed us like princes. High wife
        <lb/>
        also Scotch was very nice &amp; we spent a
        <lb/>
        most pleasant evening. We were very
        <lb/>
        sorry to come away from that place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't remember whether I told you
        <lb/>
        in my last letter that amongst the other
        <lb/>
        things I am sending to you, there is a
        <lb/>
        ring for you. I hope you won't be very
        <lb/>
        disappointed but I cannot see much hope
        
        <pb n="5" facs="#rb029e" xml:id="t1-body-x9-pb1"/>
        
        of getting a decent mummied cat, so
        <lb/>
        I got this ring instead. It is a scarab,
        <lb/>
        genuine (of course the setting is modern)
        <lb/>
        of a god 1700 BC making it 3600
        <lb/>
        years old. I am enclosing the guarantee        
        <lb/>
        of genuineness &amp; here is the translation
        <lb/>
        "Ring in gold 18 Carat and Genuine
        <lb/>
        Scarab of <name type="person">Amen-Rā</name> of the 18th Dynasty
        <lb/>
        1700 B.C."
      </p>
      <p>
        I do hope you will like it, you
        <lb/>
        will notice that it works on a swivel.
      </p>
      <p>
        These genuine scarabs are rather
        <lb/>
        hard to get, imitations are countless &amp;
        <lb/>
        very difficult to tell from the real ones        
      </p>
      <p>
      I spent 1 1/2 hours with the dealer
      <lb/>
      bargaining and at last got it for
      <lb/>
      a little more than my own price &amp;
      <lb/>
        a good deal less than his. If it does
        <lb/>
        not fit you, you can easily get it made
        <lb/>
        a little larger. Look after it, because
        <lb/>
        it is a good one and I don't think
        <lb/>
        you will find many like it in
        <lb/>
        <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name>
      </p>
        <p>
          I hope you won't be very dis-
          
          <pb n="6" facs="#rb029f" xml:id="t1-body-x13-pb1"/>
          
          appointed about the cat, but what I
          <lb/>
          could find were such poor specimens,
          <lb/>
          just bundles of rags &amp; nothing at all
          <lb/>
          to show they were anything else          
        </p>
        <p>
          Have just heard there is every
          <lb/>
          possibility of our being here another month!
          <lb/>
          I do hope in many ways it is not true.
        </p>
     <p>
       It was rather curious you asking
       <lb/>
       about my relations with <name type="person" ref="#CYH" key="CYH">Pinkie</name>, because
       <lb/>
       up to the day your letter arrived we
       <lb/>
       have been the very best of friends, on that
       <lb/>
       day the first day I was ill with my
       <lb/>
       'Gyppy tummy' he tried to do a rather
       <lb/>
       mean thing over a horse, consequently I
       <lb/>
       have written him off the slate for the
       <lb/>
       time being anyway. I can see he is
       <lb/>
       already ashamed of himself so I don't
       <lb/>
       suppose it will last long
     </p>
      <p>
        It is quite time we all got away
        <lb/>
        from here, there is a lot of crawling &amp;
        <lb/>
        underhand work going on, it is very
        <lb/>
        disgusting. It is a pity that men
        <lb/>
        don't change their spots when they put on a
        
        <pb n="7" facs="#rb029g" xml:id="t1-body-x16-pb1"/>
        
        uniform. It will soon stop though
        <lb/>
        when we really get to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        A party went up to <name type="place" ref="#LUX" key="LUX">Luxor</name> the 
        <lb/>
        other day, a three day trip. I should
        <lb/>
        have gone if I had been alright. It was
        <lb/>
        rather a rush, but they seem to
        <lb/>
        have enjoyed it. It is suprising how
        <lb/>
        indifferent one becomes to ruins &amp; things
        <lb/>
        after a while. Perhaps it is
        <lb/>
        because we are not able to understand
        <lb/>
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dear you needn't worry your
        <lb/>
        head over these exotic beauties, that
        <lb/>
        you call them, that I may meet here.
        <lb/>
        There are lovely women here of course &amp;
        <lb/>
        also they are exquisitley dressed, but you
        <lb/>
        forgot that they can only live in an
        <lb/>
        artificial atmosphere, and that mountain
        <lb/>
        daisies flourish at altitudes they can't
        <lb/>
        breath in. I am not in the least
        <lb/>
        likely to lose my head over any of them.
        <lb/>
        They appeal to one's vanity nothing more,
        <lb/>
        &amp; anything artificial never did appeal to
        <lb/>
        me.

        I have not recieved any of the parcels
        <lb/>
        you have sent me yet. There is something
        <lb/>
        wrong with the parcel delivery I think.
        <lb/>
        Please don't send me a lot of things dear.
        <lb/>
        I am very well supplied. If you like you
        <lb/>
        can send me that heavy pair of brown
        <lb/>
        boots I left behind, the ones without
        <lb/>
        the caps, they will be very useful if I
        <lb/>
        can get them
