            I have several
            <lb/>
            of your letters to answer &amp; lots
            <lb/>
            of things to tell you, as it is
            <lb/>
            a couple of weeks since I wrote.
            <lb/>
            You will be sorry to hear
            <lb/>
            that my old insides have
            <lb/>
            been giving me some trouble
            <lb/>
            and I have been suffering
            <lb/>
            from enteritis, accordingly
            <lb/>
            I was packed off to <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>,
            <lb/>
            &amp; from thence on here to 
            <lb/>
            <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name> which is one of the
            <lb/>
            most beautiful places I have
            <lb/>
            ever seen.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            It is awfully disappointing
            <lb/>
            to me to be ill like this &amp;
            <lb/>
            it may mean that if I 
            <lb/>
            don't get quite well soon, I
            
            <pb n="2" facs="#rb050b" xml:id="t1-body-x3-pb1"/>
            
            may have to take a job at the base or else get sent
            <lb/>
            back to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name>  You see unless one's insides are absolutely well
            <lb/>
            it is impossible to digest the rough camp food.  I am
            <lb/>
            very down in the dumps over it, as of course there is
            <lb/>
            always the possibility of it spelling the death knell to
            <lb/>
            all my hopes and aspirations.

        <p>
            I got your cable the night after I arrived in <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>
            <lb/>
            &amp; replied to it next day.  I was pleased to have it. Of
            <lb/>
            course there is nothing seriously wrong with me, and I
            <lb/>
            can get about quite well except for a certain amount
            <lb/>
            of weakness.  I wish I could get to <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name>! I hear
            <lb/>
            that any trained Colonial officers are getting some
            <lb/>
            splendid billets in the new army. Don't you worry
            <lb/>
            <name type="person" ref="#MGB" key="MGB">old girl</name>, it will be alright in the end, and it is
            <lb/>
            quite possible I am making a mountain out of a

            mole hill.

        <p>
            I got a batch of letters from you in <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>, but
            <lb/>
            one had gone to <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name>, and one I particularly wanted
            <lb/>
            because in it you would have told me how the <name type="person">Hay's</name> 
            <lb/>
            took the news of <name type="person">Harold</name>'s death.
        </p>

            Am sorry to hear your teeth are so troublesome, I think

            the bull by the horns &amp; have
            <lb/>
            the whole lot fixed up properly.

            you see it may play up
            <lb/>
            with her later on.

        <p>
            Keep on with your writing,
            <lb/>
            dear, I am quite sure you
            <lb/>
            can do it if you have the
            
            <pb n="4" facs="#rb050d" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
            
            time.  Don't set to much
            <lb/>
            store on calling anything
            <lb/>
            by a "<name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name> Author",
            <lb/>
            I think it would be
            <lb/>
            much better to have your
            <lb/>
            name &amp; if you like <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New
                <lb/>
                Zealand</name> after it, or perhaps
            <lb/>
            your name alone, the preface
            <lb/>
            might say something about
            <lb/>
            <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name>.  I don't quite
            <lb/>
            agree that everything Colonial
            <lb/>
            will boom after the war,
            <lb/>
            because you must remember
            <lb/>
            that we are a very tiny drop
            <lb/>
            in the ocean, and things
            <lb/>
            in <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name> are going to take
            <lb/>
            a great deal of adjusting
            <lb/>
            afterwards. However if you
            <lb/>
            think it is best do it.

            You know you always make me smile when you say you
            <lb/>
            are afraid of doing silly things when you meet people.
            <lb/>
            Let me assure you that most of them have the most
            <lb/>
            appalling manners, and from what I saw of the English
            <lb/>
            in <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> they are very catty. Being an onlooker myself
            <lb/>
            I had a good time but they are all little cliques &amp; 
            <lb/>
            from things the <name type="person">Perrotts</name> told me, very petty.  I think
            <lb/>
            I shall give up all idea of the Egyptian Army, having 
            <lb/>
            now experienced summer in this part of the world,
            <lb/>
            I know that none of us could stand it. In fact I
            <lb/>
            put my present illness down principally to the awful
            <lb/>
            heat. The winter of course is lovely, but it would
            <lb/>
            mean that in the summer you would have to go to 
            <lb/>
            <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name> or somewhere, and I am afraid that would
            <lb/>
            be rather too expensive.

        <p>
            <name type="person" ref="#ARH" key="ARH">Rhodes</name> didn't send you that photograph of himself,
            <lb/>
            I got it from him, and sent it with the others,
            <lb/>
            because I cannot keep photos here. He will get a 
            <lb/>
            shock if you write and thank him for it!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That is terribly bad news you tell me of the <name type="person" ref="#FIN">Finch's</name>,

            you poor old thing what 
            <lb/>
            a wretched time you must
            <lb/>
            have had, but I am
            <lb/>
            very glad you did all you could,
            <lb/>
            and took responsibility when
            <lb/>
            it was necessary.  I do
            <lb/>
            hope to hear he is better
            <lb/>
            now.  I had no idea
            <lb/>
            she was anticipating 
            <lb/>
            happenings, letters have
            <lb/>
            been very erratic arriving
            <lb/>
            lately.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            These <name type="person">Cox</name> people seem
            <lb/>
            to be beyond a joke, I half
            <lb/>
            thought of enclosing a letter
            <lb/>
            for you to send to him if
            <lb/>
            you thought fit, telling him
            <lb/>
            that if you required his
            <lb/>
            help you would doubtless
            
            <pb n="7" facs="#rb050g" xml:id="t1-body-x12-pb1"/>
            
            let him know; but on con-
            <lb/>
            sideration I arrived at the 
            <lb/>
            conclusion, that it would
            <lb/>
            reach you so long after, that
            <lb/>
            there would not be much 
            <lb/>
            use in stirring up the 
            <lb/>
            whole thing again. I
            <lb/>
            hope you have had no
            <lb/>
            further trouble with anyone.
            <lb/>
            Give them both my love &amp;
            <lb/>
            tell them I hope to be
            <lb/>
            there for the christening?
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am glad the parcel 
            <lb/>
            arrived safely, but sorry so
            <lb/>
            many things were broken,
            <lb/>
            I suppose they will mend.
            <lb/>
            So you like your ring do
            <lb/>
            you, you don't say if it
            <lb/>
            fits you or will require to
            
            <pb n="8" facs="#rb050h" xml:id="t1-body-x13-pb1"/>
            
            be altered.  It is a fairly
            <lb/>
            good specimen for its size.

        <p>
            When I left <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name>, I
            <lb/>
            was put on board a
            <lb/>
            hospital ship, a converted
            <lb/>
            P&amp;O. liner, and I asked
            <lb/>
            the matron in a hesitating
            <lb/>
            sort of voice if I could have
            <lb/>
            a fresh water bath. You
            <lb/>
            see water is so terribly
            <lb/>
            scarce round there &amp; I
            <lb/>
            thought it might be salt,
            <lb/>
            when she said, <quote>'Yes, a hot
            <lb/>
            one if you like'</quote>, I nearly
            <lb/>
            wept with joy. Do you 
            <lb/>
            know I had two, one after
            <lb/>
            the other and then I was
            <lb/>
            not clean!!  I didn't think
            <lb/>
            it was possible to be so
            
            <pb n="9" facs="#rb050i" xml:id="t1-body-x14-pb1"/>
            
            dirty. I wish I could 
            <lb/>
            <hi rend="strike">ho</hi> explain the joys of that
            <lb/>
            bath, it defys description.
            <lb/>
            The next day we went to <name type="place" ref="#LEM" key="LEM">Lemnos</name> and transferred there
            <lb/>
            to another P&amp;O boat, fitted
            <lb/>
            as a naval hospital ship
            <lb/>
            which took me to <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>.
            <lb/>
            Baths every day, clean
            <lb/>
            clothes &amp; food minus flies.
            <lb/>
            On arrival at <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>,
            <lb/>
            I was sent to 15 General 
            <lb/>
            hospital, which had been 
            <lb/>
            a school. There I found
            <lb/>
            <name type="person">Gresson</name>, recovering from
            <lb/>
            his wound and waiting
            <lb/>
            for a boat for <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name> He
            <lb/>
            was rather badly hit but
            <lb/>
            will get alright. There
            
            <pb n="10" facs="#rb050j" xml:id="t1-body-x14-pb2"/>
            
            also I had news of <name type="person">Bowie</name>'s

            death at <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>. Poor old

            chap it was awfully sad.
            <lb/>
            He was only a week there
            <lb/>
            before he was taken ill.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I was well looked after 
            <lb/>
            in <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>, only the
            <lb/>
            heat kept me back a lot.
            <lb/>
            I saw <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> who is there

            with his mules, he is not

            saw <name type="person" ref="#LAM">Lampen</name> &amp; <name type="person">Avery</name>.
            <lb/>
            <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> took me out to

            the races, I stayed for 3
            <lb/>
            races and actually made
            <lb/>
            a little money, principally
            <lb/>
            through realising the fact
            <lb/>
            I knew nothing about the

            horses.

            I was in <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name> a

            week and was then sent
            <lb/>
            on to the convalescent camp
            <lb/>
            at <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name>. We had a

            good run over in the 'Surada'
            <lb/>
            a British India boat, built

            for carrying horses &amp; coolies,

            but I was comfortable

            sending some photos &amp;

            postcards, which will give

            We are 6,000 feet above

            the sea, in a pine forest,

            climb it when I am a

            <lb/>
            motored up from the beach,

            through vineyards &amp; cultivated

            villages, &amp; picturesque
            <lb/>
            Cypriotes.  The drive
            <lb/>
            was indescribable all uphill,
            <lb/>
            and with the most as-
            <lb/>
            tounding twists &amp; turns in
            <lb/>
            the road, you can see

            glimpses of it in some of

            the photos.  It is 36

            miles from the beach, &amp;
            <lb/>
            takes nearly 4 hours in
            <lb/>
            car, so that will

            <lb/>
            We had to water 5 times,

            everthing boiled.

            they are a pretty scratch
