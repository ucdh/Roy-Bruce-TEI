            <p>This last week has been
                <lb/>
                quite an exciting one.  Events are beginning
                <lb/>
                to march.  The whole of the infantry were
                <lb/>
                sent off to the canal at a few hours notice,
                <lb/>
                and there has already been a small
                <lb/>
                skirmish a few miles from the canal.  The 
                <lb/>
                Turks have managed to cross the desert, I 
                <lb/>
                believe by building a line of railway behind
                <lb/>
                them.  They are in large force I believe,
                <lb/>
                but I don't know anything else about them,
                <lb/>
                or even how many troops we have on the 
                <lb/>
                canal, but there are a great number.  There
                <lb/>
                are of course all kind of wild rumours
                <lb/>
                as to our movements but still I do not
                <lb/>
                think we shall go there unless it is
                <lb/>
                absolutely necessary, on account of our horses.
                <lb/>
                We may of course be employed to follow
                <lb/>
                them up after they have been defeated,
                <lb/>
                or possibly go by boat somewhere &amp; get in
                <lb/>
                behind them.  My own opinion still is
                <lb/>
                that we shall go to <name type="place" ref="#EUR" key="EUR">Europe</name> about the
                <lb/>
                second week in March.
            </p>
            
            <p>There was great disgust amongst

                our fellows at the infantry getting a
                <lb/>
                show first, but at present our horses would
                <lb/>
                be quite useless there.
            </p>
            
            <p>The infantry are very good now.  I only
                <lb/>
                hope that we have improved to the same
                <lb/>
                extent.  We have worked pretty hard to
                <lb/>
                get efficient &amp; we must be improving
                <lb/>
                because we are not being worked so hard 
                <lb/>
                now &amp; get two half holidays per week.  
                <lb/>
                Everyone is very keen to get away from here
                <lb/>
                &amp; do a little.
            </p>
            
            <p>The reinforcements are arriving.  The
                <lb/>
                infantry are here having disembarked at
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#SUZ" key="SUZ">Suez</name>.  Guns went on to <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name> &amp; will
                <lb/>
                probably be down tonight. I had a yarn 
                <lb/>
                with <name type="person" ref="#SEY">Seymour</name> &amp; <name type="person" ref="#SPR">Sparrow</name> this afternoon.
                <lb/>
                They are both very fit and quite amusing in
                <lb/>
                their khaki.  <name type="person" ref="#PET">Pete</name> is a mean as ever.  They 
                <lb/>
                are both in the Army Service Corps &amp; seem 
                <lb/>
                to like it.  <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> has not arrived yet.
                <lb/>
                <name type="person" ref="#PET">Pete</name> seemed quite pleased with the housewife
                <lb/>
                you made for him.
            </p>
            
            <p>Yesterday afternoon I had a great time
                <lb/>
                with <name type="person" ref="#MAC">Marchant</name> in the bazaars.  I went to 
                <lb/>
                look for a cat for you, but so far have
                <lb/>
                not been able to get one.  We got into a
                <lb/>
                shop of antiquities in the <name type="place" ref="#MBA" key="MBA">Mousky Bazaar</name>,
                
                <pb n="3" facs="#rb024c" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
                
                and it was lovely.  There was a copy of
                <lb/>
                the Koran 1000 years old, all hand written
                <lb/>
                on parchment only £500 - An opalescent 
                <lb/>
                Persian bowl, a little larger than a finger
                <lb/>
                bowl, a sort of semi-transparent pale blue, 
                <lb/>
                £180 - A copy of Omar Khayam on deer 
                <lb/>
                skin with hand painted illustrations, hundreds
                <lb/>
                of years old £200 - All kinds of mats, brasses,
                <lb/>
                boxes, jewellery, parchments varying in price 
                <lb/>
                from £30 to hundreds.  A most glorious
                <lb/>
                collection.  We spent two hours there &amp; they
                <lb/>
                gave us tea in little glass bowls without
                <lb/>
                milk.  All I could do was to gasp in
                <lb/>
                impotent rage that I could buy nothing.
                <lb/>
                You would enjoy yourself there.  The only
                <lb/>
                mummy they had was a bird, but I 
                <lb/>
                did not get it as they are going to try &amp;
                <lb/>
                get me a cat.  There were lovely Egyptian
                <lb/>
                scarabs (carved beetles) all prices. I have never
                <lb/>
                seen such a collection before except in museums.
            </p>
            
            <p>Afterwards we had afternoon tea on 
                <lb/>
                the balcony at <name type="place" ref="#SHP" key="SHP">Shepheard's</name> &amp; listened to the
                <lb/>
                band.
            </p>
            
            <p>It is getting very warm here now, &amp;
                <lb/>
                the heat in the middle of the day is very
                <lb/>
                trying to one's eyes, expecially in the desert.
                <lb/>
                I am glad I brought my smoked glasses with me.
                
                <pb n="4" facs="#rb024d" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
                
                I haven't touched this for nearly a week.
                <lb/>
                We are working night &amp; day very hard now,
                <lb/>
                &amp; I think the time is not very far distant 
                <lb/>
                when we shall be making a move.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I saw <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> the other day &amp; he
                <lb/>
                nearly fell over at the sight of me.  He said
                <lb/>
                he had never seen such a change in 
                <lb/>
                anyone &amp; he could not believe it possible
                <lb/>
                that I was the same person who left
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">NZ</name> 6 months ago.  He told me he had
                <lb/>
                had his doubts about my standing the 
                <lb/>
                racket of field service but he was satisfied
                <lb/>
                that it had absolutely made me.  I am
                <lb/>
                telling you fully what he said in order 
                <lb/>
                that you may realise in his own words
                <lb/>
                "You are the picture of health you must

                <lb/>
                need not worry about my health any
                <lb/>
                more.  You know really, I am enjoying
                <lb/>
                myself, &amp; the longest days in the field
                <lb/>
                only make me comfortably tired.

            <p>
                <name type="person" ref="#HAR">Hardy</name> is here &amp; <name type="person" ref="#MCN">Mancanors</name> both apparently

                small skirmishes on the canal, and a few
                <lb/>
                men have been wounded - none so far
                <lb/>
                seriously.  We may go there yet but still
                <lb/>
                I don't think so.  <name type="place" ref="#EUR" key="EUR">Europe</name> may see us next

                month, and unless the German lines are

                broken we shall be doing mostly infantry
                <lb/>
                work as there is no scope for horses at
                <lb/>

            <p>There were some sports for the men
                <lb/>
                here the other afternoon, and the funniest
                <lb/>
                thing was polo on donkeys.  Sometimes the 
                <lb/>
                donkeys would go, sometimes they wouldn't.
                <lb/>
                It kept us very much amused.
