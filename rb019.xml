                    a very calm sea, so smooth that the motion

                    I do not know yet the number of her guns,
                    <lb/>
                    but some are 11 inch. The "Minotaur" carries

                    imagined all kinds of things. It turned

                    <lb/>
                    &amp; we might almost have been sailing on a

                    be their first taste of war conditions. During

                    dinner an order came down to cover all
                    <lb/>
                    lights on portholes etc, and we go along
                    <lb/>
                    showing from the outside as few lights
                    <lb/>
                    as possible, in fact only navigation 
                    <lb/>
                    lights are exposed. This is adopted 
                    <lb/>
                    as a precautionary measure, in case
                    <lb/>
                    any German ships may be about.

                    This morning we awoke to rain
                    <lb/>
                    and a choppy sea. Practically no work
                    <lb/>
                    was done except such as was absolutely
                    <lb/>
                    necessay, looking after the horses etc.
                    <lb/>
                    The men, or a large proportion of them
                    <lb/>
                    were and are suffering a good deal
                    <lb/>
                    from mal de mer and generally presented
                    <lb/>
                    a very woebegone appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the day the rain ceased &amp;

                    the wind freshened &amp; the sea rose a little,
                    <lb/>
                    adding somewhat to the general misery on
                    <lb/>
                    board. This is certainly one of the 
                    <lb/>
                    best sea boats of the lot, judging by the sight
                    <lb/>
                    of the others rolling &amp; pitching about. I
                    <lb/>
                    forgot to add that we sail 3 cable lengths
                    <lb/>
                    apart (about 600 yards) &amp; roughly 1 mile
                    <lb/>
                    between the two lines.

                    Nearly everyone has gone to bed although
                    <lb/>
                    it is only 8.30 p.m. I am sure in many

                    This morning was fine 
                    <lb/>
                    with a fairly heavy swell which did not
                    <lb/>
                    improve the health of the men &amp; horses.
                    <lb/>
                    I was detailed for orderly officer which means 
                    <lb/>
                    that I keep two ships watches of 4 hours
                    <lb/>
                    each during the 24 hours. Today I was
                    <lb/>
                    on from 12 noon until 4, and I go on
                    <lb/>
                    again @ 12 midnight until 4 a.m. My
                    <lb/>
                    duties consist of wandering all over the 
                    <lb/>
                    ship and reporting once every hour.

                    It is a tiring occupation as there are so
                    <lb/>
                    many holds to get in &amp; out of, and it
                    <lb/>

                    <lb/>
                    Very short, owing to the sea and the wind.
                    <lb/>
                    I did not attend being occupied in fixing

                    up some back pay for the men, with the

                    <lb/>
                    supper. Surely we are likely to get very

                    until we had been talking some

                    little time.

                    <lb/>
                    would put a horse of his with mine.
                    <lb/>
                    It is apparently a very favourite

                    for 5 furlongs. It is called Gold Bird,

                    and is a very large chestnut, standing
                    <lb/>
                    over 17 hands. Nothing much to look
                    <lb/>
                    at, and privately I have my doubts

                    one said they thought the General was

                    on board, when one of the men
                    <lb/>
                    remarked "Yes, general disorder." It
                    <lb/>
                    was rather funny.

                    There are over 50. and some are weird

                    My last page
                    <lb/>
                    finished the evening before we arrived at 
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="place" ref="#HOB" key="HOB">Hobart</name>. Land was in sight when we awoke
                    <lb/>
                    on Wednesday morning and about 11.30 we
                    <lb/>
                    dropped anchor in the stream. The day was
                    <lb/>
                    gloriously fine and very warm. The vessels
                    <lb/>
                    on the right of the two lines moved up to
                    <lb/>
                    the wharf and took on a few stores etc while
                    <lb/>
                    the men went on a route march round
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="place" ref="#HOB" key="HOB">Hobart</name>. Shortly after 6.30 pm our turn 
                    <lb/>
                    came and we moved up alongside. There 
                    <lb/>
                    was a big crowd down, but we had taken
                    <lb/>
                    the people by surprise, no one knew of our
                    <lb/>
                    arrival. It was a lovely evening, just 
                    <lb/>
                    like summer, it was quite funny to see 
                    <lb/>
                    all the people in summer clothes. During
                    <lb/>
                    the afternoon we had interestedly watched
                    <lb/>
                    the lads &amp; and lassies making love on a small
                    <lb/>
                    neck of land rather prettily planted &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    evidently a favourite resort. Our binoculars
                    <lb/>
                    got a lot of use that afternoon, and we
                    <lb/>
                    saw some really funny sights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No leave was granted in the evening
                    
                    <pb n="17" facs="#rb019n" xml:id="t1-body-d5-x3-pb1"/>
                    
                    which was a great disappointment to the men, 
                    <lb/>
                    but as <name type="place" ref="#HOB" key="HOB">Hobart</name> has not the most savoury of
                    <lb/>
                    reputations in some respects it was deemed
                    <lb/>
                    better to be sure on board than sorry afterwards.
                    <lb/>
                    Things are so bad there that the Australian
                    <lb/>
                    fleet was not allowed to call there last time
                    <lb/>
                    she was round.
                </p>
                <p>As soon as we were alongside, women
                    <lb/>
                    in the most brazen way came down to the 
                    <lb/>
                    ships and passed up their addresses through
                    <lb/>
                    portholes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was rather fortunate in getting 
                    <lb/>
                    ashore for a run as I was sent to the 
                    <lb/>
                    "Maunganui" with a message and this
                    <lb/>
                    entailed a walk of nearly 1/2 a mile to
                    <lb/>
                    another wharf. After I had finished on 
                    <lb/>
                    the "Maunganui" I went for a short walk 
                    <lb/>
                    into the town, but as I was alone, didn't
                    <lb/>
                    know anyone &amp; all the shops were shut, it
                    <lb/>
                    was very dull and I soon returned to the
                    <lb/>
                    ship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Thursday morning (another lovely
                    <lb/>
                    morning) we got up at 5 o'clock and
                    <lb/>
                    about 7.30 went for a nine mile march.
                    
                    <pb n="18" facs="#rb019o" xml:id="t1-body-d5-x6-pb1"/>
                    
                    It was very nice and we were very glad of
                    <lb/>
                    the opportunity to stretch our legs. For the 
                    <lb/>
                    first hour we were leading, and of course
                    <lb/>
                    we don't know much about marching so
                    <lb/>
                    we made the pace fairly warm. It was
                    <lb/>
                    too much for the infantry who began to
                    <lb/>
                    drop out and at the end of an hour, they
                    <lb/>
                    took the lead to moderate the pace. There
                    <lb/>
                    is no doubt that it really was much too
                    <lb/>
                    fast, and we were quite glad to slow down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <name type="place" ref="#HOB" key="HOB">Hobart </name> is an awfully pretty place, &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    the views from different parts of the domain,
                    <lb/>
                    which rises behind the town are really 
                    <lb/>
                    beautiful.
                </p>
                <p>The inhabitants turned out from their
                    <lb/>
                    houses in force and rather demoralised 
                    <lb/>
                    the troops by giving them fruit etc,
                    <lb/>
                    however we got along fairly well until
                    <lb/>
                    passing a certain hotel, towards the end
                    <lb/>
                    of the march, some people rushed out with
                    <lb/>
                    large jugs of ale &amp; glasses. This was 
                    <lb/>
                    too much for some of the men, and they 
                    <lb/>

                    We all got hauled over the coals this morning, 
                    <lb/>
                    but when the senior major at the head of

                    <lb/>
                    hardly be blamed. It was really rather

                    funny, when one thought about it after-

                    We however fared better than the

                    This morning about 4 o'clock all 
                    <lb/>
                    the hooters on the ships began to hoot &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    we really thought the Philistines were
                    <lb/>
                    upon us. Some even rushed up on deck,
                    <lb/>
                    to find out it was only a fog bank we
                    <lb/>
                    had run into. I reasoned in my bunk
                    <lb/>
                    that if it was anything we should soon

                    know so why risk catching cold by getting

                    We left the "Psyche" behind at <name type="place" ref="#HOB" key="HOB">Hobart</name>,
                    <lb/>
                    and picked up the "Pyramus" instead.

                <p>
                    Oh: I nearly forgot this: the first

                    night when we ran with "lights out," the

                    "Maunganui" didn't turn hers out at

                    <lb/>
                    thought he was privileged or not) but

                    have done it since. It all seems very

                    So far there are 14 cases, it remains to be 
                    <lb/>
                    seen how much farther it will go among
                    <lb/>
                    the 1500 souls on board. <name type="person" ref="#CSB" key="CSB">Claude Bruce</name>

                    my namesake is suffering from them.

                    Someone is sure to tell you it is I. I
                    <lb/>

                    We ran into quite a crowd of 
                    <lb/>
                    whales yesterday, they were puffing and 
                    <lb/>
                    blowing all round us. Wild excitement
                    <lb/>
                    on board. Some owl suggested getting 
                    <lb/>

                <p>A certain <name type="person" ref="#CBR">Capt. Brown</name> of the infants,
                    <lb/>
                    I mean infantry, said to me yesterday:
                    <lb/>
                    "I saw one of your men wearing trousers
                    <lb/>
                    with a red stripe yesterday, our fellows
                    <lb/>
                    have been missing some clothes lately, I
                    <lb/>
                    know it was one of your men because
                    <lb/>
                    he was wearing a mounted coat."
                </p>
                <p>
                    I pointed out to him it was far
                    <lb/>
                    more likely to be one of his own crowd

                    who had pinched one of our fellows 
                    <lb/>
                    coats, and in any case, I said, if any 
                    <lb/>
                    of our fellows were seen by their mates
                    <lb/>
                    wearing infantry breeches they would tear
                    <lb/>
                    them off them. There was no further 
                    <lb/>
                    argument.

                    I have been paying the men this
                    <lb/>
                    afternoon, mostly to their satisfaction. 
                    <lb/>
                    There is no paying in cash now, every 
                    <lb/>
                    man is paid by an order on the

                    is also payable to the ships' canteen.

                    I don't think that many issued on

                    Since the canteen has been

                    taken over by the Government it is
                    <lb/>
                    going very well. Everything is very

                    cheap &amp; tobacco is sold free of duty,

                    We continue our evening lectures
                    <lb/>
                    which are becoming very interesting,
                    <lb/>
                    although it is a pity most do not
                    <lb/>
                    take more interest in them.

                    we shall stay there I have no idea.
                    <lb/>
                    It is very doubtful whether any leave
                    <lb/>
                    will be granted.

                    <lb/>
                    12 or 13 thirteen years ago it was chiefly
                    <lb/>
                    noted for two Japanese ladies, if they
                    <lb/>
                    are still there they will be rather long

                    even now. When we get past <name type="place" ref="#COL" key="COL">Colombo</name>

                    things Australasian will rapidly recede
