            <p>My prophecies were not far
                <lb/>
                wrong after all, we are leaving here next week
                <lb/>
                providing everything goes well, but I think
                <lb/>
                not for <name type="place" ref="#FRA" key="FRA">France</name>.  From what I know &amp; 
                <lb/>
                what I hear we are going somewhere in
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#TUR" key="TUR">Turkey</name> and I suppose our ultimate aim is
                <lb/>
                the capture of <name type="place" ref="#CON" key="CON">Constantinople</name>.  After all it
                <lb/>
                is quite reasonable.  We are at war with <name type="place" ref="#TUR" key="TUR">Turkey</name>
                <lb/>
                and we are the nearest force available for the
                <lb/>
                subjection of that country, just as we were
                <lb/>
                the nearest force available for the defence of
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> against the Turk.  Now that there is
                <lb/>
                no longer need for a large force here we shall
                <lb/>
                got to the nearest place where one is required,
                <lb/>
                which at present is <name type="place" ref="#TUR" key="TUR">Turkey</name>.  I do not know
                <lb/>
                where our base is to be but it may be <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name>,
                <lb/>
                or else an island higher up nearer the 
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#DAN" key="DAN">Dardenelles</name>.  By the time we have finished
                <lb/>
                this campaign we will have seen something
                <lb/>
                of the world.  Well, I suppose when we
                <lb/>
                leave <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> we leave the lighter side of war
                <lb/>
                behind us and become a little more in
                <lb/>
                earnest.  I think no one will be sorry to
                
                <pb n="2" facs="#rb027b" xml:id="t1-body-x2-pb1"/>
                
                go, we shall have been here well over three
                <lb/>
                months, and there is so much to be done
                <lb/>
                elsewhere, although of course we might have
                <lb/>
                quite easily have had as much &amp; more than 
                <lb/>
                we wanted here.  I must say it has been
                <lb/>
                an extremely instructive &amp; pleasant time,
                <lb/>
                we have worked hard, really far harder
                <lb/>
                than we shall work in the field, except
                <lb/>
                of course at times, we are better soldiers &amp;
                <lb/>
                in many cases I hope better men, we have
                <lb/>
                had our amusements of a very varied kind,
                <lb/>
                and of a kind new to most.  Some have
                <lb/>
                suffered, some poor devils will carry the
                <lb/>
                marks to their graves, the majority have
                <lb/>
                come through with broadened minds &amp; a
                <lb/>
                more tolerant outlook.  Should it be the
                <lb/>
                fortune for most of us to come through this,
                <lb/>
                I venture to say that the men who return
                <lb/>
                to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name> will in many ways considerably
                <lb/>
                alter some of the views held in that country.
                <lb/>
                I do not necessarily mean as regards military
                <lb/>
                training, but in the civil and social life
                <lb/>
                of the country.  Some day you &amp; I will
                <lb/>
                come here, and I will take you to the places 
                <lb/>
                I have been to, and we will go out &amp; camp
                <lb/>
                in the desert &amp; among the orange groves &amp; date
                <lb/>
                plantations, just as I am doing now &amp; you
                
                <pb n="3" facs="#rb027c" xml:id="t1-body-x2-pb2"/>
                
                will see the Arab &amp; his family, with his ox &amp;
                <lb/>
                his ass exactly as he was thousands of years
                <lb/>
                ago.  It is extraordinary, nothing has altered,
                <lb/>
                not even the Hebraic features.
            </p>
            <p>
                We treked for four days last week, but 
                <lb/>
                did not get so far as <name type="place" ref="#ZAG" key="ZAG">Zagazig</name>, because the
                <lb/>
                General wanted us back a day earlier, &amp;
                <lb/>
                launched the Australian division against
                <lb/>
                us to make us fight our way back to camp.
                <lb/>
                The trek was a great successs, really the
                <lb/>
                mounted Brigade is quite imposing on the
                <lb/>
                march, with all waggons &amp; ambulances &amp; 
                <lb/>
                things we take up nearly 2 miles of road
                <lb/>
                space.  In the second night we got as far
                <lb/>
                as <name type="place" ref="#BIL" key="BIL">Bilbeis</name>; I do not know whether it will 
                <lb/>
                be marked on your map, but it is roughly
                <lb/>
                18 miles South of <name type="place" ref="#ZAG" key="ZAG">Zagazig</name> which is roughly
                <lb/>
                40 miles north of <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>.  <name type="place" ref="#BIL" key="BIL">Bilbeis</name> is a
                <lb/>
                rather important trading centre for caravans
                <lb/>
                from <name type="place" ref="#SYR" key="SYR">Syria</name>, it is about 15 miles due west 
                <lb/>
                of <name type="place" ref="#TEK" key="TEK"><choice><sic>Tel el kebir</sic><corr>Tel el Kebir</corr></choice></name>.  We had hoped to go out
                <lb/>
                &amp; see the battle field, but fate &amp; the General
                <lb/>
                ruled otherwise.

                Always it happens when I sit down to
                <lb/>
                write to you and catch a thread that some-
                <lb/>
                thing intervenes and the thread is broken, it
                <lb/>
                has been so this afternoon, my sergeant came
                
                <pb n="4" facs="#rb027d" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
                
                to ask about something at 4 o'clock &amp; it is
                <lb/>
                now 7.30. &amp; the thread is of course broken.

            <p>Last Sunday, <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> &amp; I spent in the
                <lb/>
                Museum.  It is indescribable, all Egyptian,
                <lb/>
                rooms &amp; rooms, mummies, statues, pottery,
                <lb/>
                gorgeous jewellery, anything from 6/7000 B.C.
                <lb/>
                I can't describe it, we revelled in it until
                <lb/>
                we were turned out.
            </p>
            <p>I bought one or two small things which
                <lb/>
                I hope will reach you safely.
            </p>
            <p>The little statuette dates 3000 B.C. these
                <lb/>
                are found inside the sarcophagi, and are 
                <lb/>
                put there to answer the questions of the gods
                <lb/>
                when they come to ask questions of the body.
            </p>
            <p>The arrow heads are bronze &amp; date from
                <lb/>
                the Roman invasion of <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>.
            </p>
            <p>The little blue scarab is very old, but is
                <lb/>
                not a good specimen, good ones are extremely
                <lb/>
                rare and very expensive.  One can however
                <lb/>
                see the beetle &amp; the cobra's head.
            </p>
            <p>All the above are absolutely genuine
                <lb/>
                I bought them at the Museum &amp; they are
                <lb/>
                guaranteed.  There are also 2 old pipes,
                <lb/>
                about 200 years old, picked up in old <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>.
                <lb/>
                <lb/>
            </p>
            <p>
                The black veil is worn by the married
                <lb/>
                Arab women, the metal part lays along the 
                <lb/>
                nose, &amp; the band fastens behind the ears.

                They must be very uncomfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                The little mat was worked in an
                <lb/>
                Egyptian harem, in the centre is the
                <lb/>
                imperial Turkish seal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other mat is cheap Egyptian stuff,
                <lb/>
                only interesting because it is Egyptian.
            </p>

                I don't know what to do about your 
                <lb/>
                cat.  I cannot get one anywhere.  They
                <lb/>
                say they only get them occasionally now.
                <lb/>
                Three people have been trying to get one 
                <lb/>
                now for 2 months &amp; so far they have not
                <lb/>
                succeeded.  I have been shown several
                <lb/>
                small mummied animals, but they were
                <lb/>
                uninteresting.
            </p>
            <p>
                So far what I have got it not very 
                <lb/>
                much, and I do not think there will
                <lb/>
                be time to get anything more.  They will
                <lb/>
                however serve as souvenirs.

                is just what one might expect from
                <lb/>
                <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrew</name>'s description.  A clever man &amp; difficult
                <lb/>
                to know, made as a hatter.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <name type="person" ref="#MAC">Marchant</name> has been made quarter-
                <lb/>
                master to the Regiment, with the honorary
                <lb/>
                rank of Captain.  I wish him luck, it is
                <lb/>
                a tedious job.
            </p>
            
            <p>You ask in your last letter whether

                <lb/>
                or here.  There are no such things as acting
                <lb/>
                appointments.  Temporary rank was granted
                <lb/>
                to certain officers of the Staff Corps subject

                that I am away &amp; back in civilisation
                <lb/>
                again, I marvel how anybody ever got 
                <lb/>
                on with anybody at all in the confined

                <lb/>
                dear, I am certain I can never live in 
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name> again.  I am glad I went there,
                <lb/>
                because it gave me you, but I could not
                <lb/>
                live there again after this unless something
                <lb/>
                extraordinary happens.  You will be happy
                <lb/>
                when you can see it all.  Don't think I am
                <lb/>
                carried away by the glamour of one of 
                <lb/>
                pleasure cities of the world, but I am at
                <lb/>
                home in it all.  My place is in it some-
                <lb/>
                where.  I know I am going to miss <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>
                <lb/>
                terribly.  From the latest electric lift at

                working the old wheel wells as was done
                <lb/>
                in the times of the Pharaohs.  It is
                <lb/>
                incredible but true.  The Old Testament is
                <lb/>
                spread before you here.  Certain verses of the
                <lb/>
                Psalms taken in conjunction with the
                <lb/>
                desert, take on a fresh meaning.  What
                <lb/>
                is a life amongst it all?  A thousand years
                <lb/>
                shall be as one day, &amp; one day as a thousand
                <lb/>
                years.  It is true, too true.  Tragic in its
                <lb/>
                simplicity, sublime in its grandeur.

                <name type="person" ref="#MGB" key="MGB">Poor old girl</name>, and you have to stay

                behind and miss it all, for the present,

                but I am looking forward to the days when
                <lb/>
                you shall see it, and then I think the

                fortune teller's words will come true, "At

                believe in happiness she must not grow up

                a misanthropic individual like myself.
                <lb/>
                The ideal life is duty &amp; happiness, and I
                <lb/>
                think in many cases the terms are

                other day.  A very nice letter, in which she

                wanted to know if there was anything
                <lb/>
                she could do to make me more comfortable!
                <lb/>
                If she could only see us really wallowing
                <lb/>
                in luxuries!  Awfully decent of her to write,
                <lb/>
                perhaps I shall see her some day.
