                Thanks for your congratulations
                <lb/>
                on my promotion, but it does not apply
                <lb/>
                to this force, only to the regiment in <name type="place" ref="#NZE">N.Z.</name>
                <lb/>
                consequently I won't get any more pay
                <lb/>
                worse luck. The only hope of any
                <lb/>
                promotion here is through casualties &amp;
                <lb/>
                that is not a very nice think to look
                <lb/>
                forward to. It was a rather unfortunate
                <lb/>
                thing for me that <name type="person">Hardy</name> did not pass
                <lb/>
                his examination for Major the first time.
                <lb/>
                You will remember he sat the same time
                <lb/>
                that I did and failed in one subject
                <lb/>
                by 10 marks. He failing in that subject
                <lb/>
                held my promotion up nearly a year, as
                <lb/>
                there were no vacancies for captain then.
                <lb/>
                Had he passed I would have come out with
