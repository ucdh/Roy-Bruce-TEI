                    Your letters are coming along
                    <lb/>
                    by degrees. Nos 1.2.4.5.6 are here, No 3 has
                    <lb/>
                    not yet arrived. Some papers have also arrived.
                    <lb/>
                    It is good to hear from you and to know
                    <lb/>
                    that you are alright, and to also know that
                    <lb/>
                    for a little time at least there is a prospect
                    <lb/>
                    of hearing regularly from you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    
                    You mention in one of your
                    <lb/>
                    earlier letters that you had not received any
                    <lb/>
                    money from the Government. I am sure you
                    <lb/>
                    will have received it by now, but if you
                    <lb/>
                    have not, get <name type="person" ref="#FIN">Finch</name> to shake them up. It
                    <lb/>
                    was to be addressed to you c/o Perry Perry &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    Kimmency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't think you need worry
                    <lb/>
                    about <name type="person" ref="#MTA">Mrs Taylor</name> having any ulterior motives
                    <lb/>
                    in cultivating your friendship. From what I 
                    <lb/>
                    know she is a woman without many friends,
                    <lb/>
                    in fact I think <name type="person" ref="#MNO">Mrs Norman</name> was about the
                    <lb/>
                    only one she had. There is no reason why
                    
                    <pb n="2" facs="#rb022b" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x4-pb1"/>
                    
                    
                    you should not appeal to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your letters are most fascinating,
                    <lb/>
                    there is such a lot of detail in them
                    <lb/>
                    of the <unclear>rie intunie</unclear> that makes me quite
                    <lb/>
                    ashamed of my cursory epistles. I cannot
                    <lb/>
                    describe things on paper, if only I could
                    <lb/>
                    I could write volumes about this country.
                    <lb/>
                    Last Sunday we had a great expedition.
                    <lb/>
                    Six of us, <name type="person" ref="#HTT">Hutton</name>, <name type="person" ref="#MYN">Mayne</name>, <name type="person" ref="#BLT">Blackett</name>, <name type="person" ref="#BAR">Barker</name>,
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="person" ref="#DAI">Dailey</name> &amp; myself, made an excursion to the
                    <lb/>
                    site of the oldest known city in the world,
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="place" ref="#MEM" key="MEM">Memphis</name>. We started from here about 8
                    <lb/>
                    o'clock &amp; trained &amp; motored to the  Pyramids,
                    <lb/>
                    there we found our guide &amp; 6 camels we
                    <lb/>
                    had chartered &amp; off we went. First of all
                    <lb/>
                    we visited the tomb of Ihi who was a 
                    <lb/>
                    king 5000 years ago. It was a sort of
                    <lb/>
                    temple hewn out of limestone nearly all
                    <lb/>
                    underground, containing various names with
                    <lb/>
                    pictures carved on the walls representing
                    <lb/>
                    episodes in his life. These are outlined in
                    <lb/>
                    colours and on several walls the colouring
                    <lb/>
                    is still almost as clear as when it was
                    
                    <pb n="3" facs="#rb022c" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x5-pb1"/>
                    
                    done, mostly in red. The sarcophagus is
                    <lb/>
                    also there a huge block of solid granite with a 
                    <lb/>
                    top. The mummy is in the Egyptian museum
                    <lb/>
                    at  <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>. From there we went to the large
                    <lb/>
                    tomb where the sacred bulls were buried. This
                    <lb/>
                    is another wonderful structure hewn out of
                    <lb/>
                    the rock underground, with long galleries
                    <lb/>
                    with pits on either side each pit holding one
                    <lb/>
                    sarcophagus. There are 24 in all, huge blocks
                    <lb/>
                    of stone, in some cases polished &amp; engraved with
                    <lb/>
                    hieroglyphics. We took candles &amp; burnt magnesium
                    <lb/>
                    wire at intervals to light up the place. There
                    <lb/>
                    is a sublime grandeur about these works which
                    <lb/>
                    makes one marvel as to what kind of people
                    <lb/>
                    these were who could conceive such things.
                    <lb/>
                    We had lunch here &amp; afterwards mounted our
                    <lb/>
                    camels &amp; went on to  <name type="place" ref="#MEM" key="MEM">Memphis</name>. The site of
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="place" ref="#MEM" key="MEM">Memphis</name> is now covered by palm groves, small
                    <lb/>
                    ponds of water &amp; a small native village.
                    <lb/>
                    Excavations here up to the present have not been
                    <lb/>
                    very extensive principally owing to lack of funds.
                    <lb/>
                    All that has been unearthed are two huge
                    <lb/>
                    colossi of Ramses II. In both these the body &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    head are perfect but the legs are broken. To give
                    <lb/>
                    you an idea of their size, the six of us stood
                    
                    <pb n="4" facs="#rb022d" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x5-pb2"/>
                    
                    easily on the body &amp; then had room to move
                    <lb/>
                    about. The carving is wonderful &amp; the expression
                    <lb/>
                    on the face defies description. Cruelty, arrogance,
                    <lb/>
                    dignity, pride, power are all contained in a 
                    <lb/>
                    few lines, in the clean shaven face. There is 
                    <lb/>
                    also a small sphinx which has recently
                    <lb/>
                    been uncovered but beyond its age is not
                    <lb/>
                    very wonderful. The figures of the colossi are 
                    <lb/>
                    white limestone &amp; the chiselling on the dress
                    <lb/>
                    is picked out in red. From there we 
                    <lb/>
                    to the  <name type="place" ref="#BRS" key="BRS">Badrashein railway station</name> &amp; trained
                    <lb/>
                    back, ending a most interesting day.
                    <lb/>
                    Our experiences on camels were funny. It 
                    <lb/>
                    was alright when we were walking but 
                    <lb/>
                    when they began to trot, ye gods, little fishes,
                    <lb/>
                    jolt, jolt, bump, bump, both hands hanging 
                    <lb/>
                    to the pommel, &amp; no steering gear that would
                    <lb/>
                    act, &amp; the animals did not understand
                    <lb/>
                    English &amp; we didn't understand Arabic &amp; the 
                    <lb/>
                    more we swore the faster they went &amp; the
                    <lb/>
                    more the boys whacked them. One old bird
                    <lb/>
                    by the wayside tried to sell me some spurious 
                    <lb/>
                    curios &amp; when I wouldn't buy gave my camel 
                    
                    <pb n="5" facs="#rb022e" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x5-pb3"/>
                    
                    an almighty welt &amp; off he went at top. Between
                    <lb/>
                    laughing at others &amp; cursing at your own camel,
                    <lb/>
                    things were quite amusing for the first hour,
                    <lb/>
                    till we got the hang of them a bit. In all
                    <lb/>
                    we did about 12 miles on them, and we were
                    <lb/>
                    very stiff &amp; sore next day. I don't think I 
                    <lb/>
                    shall join the Camel Corps. I should like to get
                    <lb/>
                    a really good camel &amp; know how to ride it
                    <lb/>
                    properly, I think then it might be a very
                    <lb/>
                    pleasant means of locomotion.

                    Another of your letters turned up yesterday,
                    <lb/>
                    No 7. No 2 is still travelling around somewhere. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    No 7 is dated Nov 30. You say a friend 
                    <lb/>
                    of <name type="person" ref="#DRY">Miss Dryden</name>'s saw us going through  <name type="place" ref="#SUZ" key="SUZ">Suez</name>. Why
                    <lb/>
                    we were going through  <name type="place" ref="#SUZ" key="SUZ">Suez</name> the day your 
                    <lb/>
                    letter was written! He must have mixed us 
                    <lb/>
                    up with some Indian transports. There were
                    <lb/>
                    36 transports &amp; 3 warships with us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am sorry to hear of <name type="person" ref="#MWA">Miss Watts</name>' brother,
                    <lb/>
                    I hope something definite has been heard from him.

                    Blackmore still performs &amp; stands on his
                    <lb/>
                    head at intervals. I ride him on short journeys
                    <lb/>
                    sometimes but he tires me out, perhaps some
                    <lb/>
                    day he will be more tractable. I am not

                    parting with him, I have two others &amp; he
                    <lb/>
                    may get alright some day.

                    Gold Bird survived the journey &amp; now 
                    <lb/>
                    lives at  Brigade Headquarters, I have not
                    <lb/>
                    seen him since he left the ship, but <name type="person" ref="#HAW">Hawkins</name>
                    <lb/>
                    says he is well.

                    So far as actual routine is concerned
                    <lb/>
                    it is not very interesting to write about.
                    <lb/>
                    Things go on fairly smoothly here now.

                    The troop is gradually becoming a troop, they
                    <lb/>
                    are a very good crowd all round &amp; certainly
                    <lb/>
                    try to do their best, of course there are
                    <lb/>
                    always a few who spoil things.

                    great astonishment. I believe he was really
                    <lb/>
                    hurt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sorry you are having a bad
                    <lb/>
                    
                    time with the dentist, hope it is all over
                    <lb/>
                    long ago.

                    We had a night out in the desert
                    <lb/>
                    the other night? Started off in the morning
                    <lb/>
                    to march on the  Sewage Farm, which is a 
                    <lb/>
                    Government experimental farm in the desert
                    
                    <pb n="7" facs="#rb022g" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x13-pb1"/>
                    
                    about 13 miles from here. We arrived safely, 
                    <lb/>
                    put the horses in an old prison yard &amp; then
                    <lb/>
                    we had afternoon tea with the manager, an
                    <lb/>
                    Englishman named <name type="person" ref="#SEL">Sellars</name> &amp; his wife. It was
                    <lb/>
                    nice to get into an English house again. We 
                    <lb/>
                    spent quite an interesting hour before we went
                    <lb/>
                    back to the<add place="inline">/</add>men , &amp; bread &amp; bully beef in the
                    <lb/>
                    open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After tea we put up a line of outposts
                    <lb/>
                    in the desert. The men dug trenches &amp; took it
                    <lb/>
                    in turns to keep watch. I found one blighter
                    <lb/>
                    of mine, (the Geraldine namesake) sound asleep at
                    <lb/>
                    2 o'clock in the morning. I stole his rifle &amp; 
                    <lb/>
                    those of the other 3 men belonging to his post, &amp; 
                    <lb/>
                    got them away without waking anybody up.
                    <lb/>
                    Needless to relate what happened when they 
                    <lb/>
                    did awake - I don't think that youth will
                    <lb/>
                    sleep again on his post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The desert is not bad to sleep on when
                    <lb/>
                    it doesn't blow. About 5 o'clock in the morning
                    <lb/>
                    a cold wind arose which later increased to a 
                    <lb/>
                    dust storm. It was very unpleasant. Work was
                    <lb/>
                    impossible you could not see 50 yards away.
                    <lb/>
                    I was sent back with the Squadron to camp
                    
                    <pb n="8" facs="#rb022h" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x15-pb1"/>
                    
                    while the others remained to see if it would
                    <lb/>
                    clean up &amp; they could do some mapping.
                    <lb/>
                    I never had such a ride before. It took 
                    <lb/>
                    me 4 hours to do 12 miles &amp; it was not
                    <lb/>
                    all desert as I cut into a plantation for
                    <lb/>
                    part of the way. Sand, grit &amp; stones in our
                    <lb/>
                    faces. You could have built a pot (chimney
                    <lb/>
                    of course) with the bricks I took out of my
                    <lb/>
                    hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are various rumours going about
                    <lb/>
                    to the effect that we are shortly making
                    <lb/>
                    a move to <name type="place" ref="#SYR" key="SYR">Syria </name>to look for Turks. But 
                    <lb/>
                    I can hardly credit it. Unless something
                    <lb/>
                    unforeseen occurs I do not think we
                    <lb/>
                    shall leave here before the beginning of
                    <lb/>
                    March &amp; then we will probably go straight
                    <lb/>
                    to  <name type="place" ref="#FRA" key="FRA">France</name>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think we are very fortunate in
                    <lb/>
                    coming to this place, as from all accounts
                    <lb/>
                    it is a very bad winter in  <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Training proceeds apace, we work
                    <lb/>
                    from 5.30am to 5pm &amp; then sometimes

                    go out for a night ride. We ought to be

                    fairly presentable soon.

                    soon, regimental this time &amp; will
                    <lb/>
                    probably be away several days.

                    The High Commissioner was out here
                    <lb/>
                    yesterday &amp; have us the usual political 
                    <lb/>
                    Sons of <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name> etc etc speech - They
                    <lb/>
                    make me sick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has been decided owing to the 
                    <lb/>
                    heavy casualty list amongst officers to
                    <lb/>
                    dress us more like the men in the field, 
                    <lb/>
                    and in future we are to wear bandoliers
                    <lb/>
                    &amp; puttees, &amp; all buttons are to be darkened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we had the usual church
                    <lb/>
                    parade in the morning, &amp; I have been 
                    <lb/>
                    pottering round camp all day as it was
                    <lb/>
                    my turn to be left in - I am going to
                    <lb/>
                    bed now &amp; I am going to close this
                    <lb/>
                    letter because if I wait till tomorrow
                    <lb/>
                    to add more I may have no time &amp; 
                    <lb/>
                    goodness knows when it will get finished.
                    <lb/>
                    The few weeks we have spent here have
                    <lb/>
                    flown like so many days, all the better
                    <lb/>
                    we will sooner be together again. 
                </p>
