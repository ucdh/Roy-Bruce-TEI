            <p>Events have been
                <lb/>
                moving for me lately with almost
                <lb/>
                startling rapidity. Ever since
                <lb/>
                I left <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> I have been running
                <lb/>
                round in circles
            </p>
            <p>
                I left <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> and
                <lb/>
                joined the brigade at <name type="place" ref="#SAL" key="SAL">Salhieh</name>
                <lb/>
                arriving one night to find I had
                <lb/>
                to leave next morning for
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#ISM" key="ISM">Ismailia</name> to take over the training
                <lb/>
                squadron I told you about.
                <lb/>
                Arrived at <name type="place" ref="#ISM" key="ISM">Ismailia</name> took over
                <lb/>
                the squadon and two days
                <lb/>
                afterwards moved with it to
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#TEK" key="TEK">Tel el Kebir</name>. Three days after
                <lb/>
                that heard the Brigade were
                <lb/>
                moving away on a stunt, wept
                <lb/>
                many tears to know I was not
                <lb/>
                to go with them so thought I

                would go up to Salhieh to say
                <lb/>

                last night to find the Colonel
                <lb/>
                was shaking up Brigades
                <lb/>
                Divisions &amp; Army Corps to get me
                <lb/>
                back in the regiment before
                <lb/>
                they moved. The chief difficulty
                <lb/>
                lay in the fact that I was
                <lb/>
                seconded from the regiment
                <lb/>
                and put on an instructional
                <lb/>
                staff for a tour of duty of from
                <lb/>
                6 to 8 months; however just
                <lb/>
                as I had given up hope a
                <lb/>
                wire came through for me to
                <lb/>
                rejoin. It was worth getting.
                <lb/>
                Nearly all the men in the
                <lb/>
                Squadron took an opportunity
                <lb/>
                to tell me how glad they were
                <lb/>
                I was coming with them, the
                <lb/>
                offices gave me a great reception,
                <lb/>
                and happening to pass the
                <lb/>
                general he stopped and said
                <lb/>
                he was pleased to have been
                <lb/>
                able to do it. Really I shall
                
                <pb n="3" facs="#rb066c" xml:id="t1-body-x3-pb2"/>
                
                soon bein to think that I
                <lb/>
                am going to be of some use
                <lb/>
                somewhere after all. Just
                <lb/>
                after all that splutter orders
                <lb/>
                came to move in an hour:
                <lb/>
                so now I am sitting in the
                <lb/>
                train going back to <name type="place" ref="#TEK" key="TEK">Tel el
                <lb/>
                Kebir</name> to get my horse &amp; kit &amp;
                <lb/>
                pick the others up sometimes
                <lb/>
                tomorrow. Here commences
                <lb/>
                another compaign. This
                <lb/>
                time what we have trained
                <lb/>
                for so long, mounted work.
                <lb/>
                Let us hope we do as well as
                <lb/>
                we are told we did at <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name>.              
            </p>
            <p>
                I did not mind com-
                <lb/>
                manding the training squad-
                <lb/>
                ron so long as the regiment
                <lb/>
                was not going after the wily
                <lb/>
                Turk or some other elusive
                <lb/>
                enermy, but to feel they were
                <lb/>
                going and I was not with
                <lb/>
                them, after nearly two years
                <lb/>
                was very hard to bear. But
                
                <pb n="3" facs="#rb066d" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
                
                everyone is happy now. I
                <lb/>
                cannot give you any details
                <lb/>
                as to how far etc we are going,
                <lb/>
                principally because I don't
                <lb/>
                know, but probably before you
                <lb/>
                get this you will know all
                <lb/>
                about it.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Have an idea where the
                <lb/>
                infantry are - remous says
                <lb/>
                anywhere in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Had an isolated letter
                <lb/>
                from you the other day, but
                <lb/>
                there is no regularity at all
                <lb/>
                now, sometimes I am several
                <lb/>
                weeks without news. I don't
                <lb/>
                worry now it is impossible
                <lb/>
                to help it. A man said to
                <lb/>
                me the other day "I envy
                <lb/>
                you your damnable calm
                <lb/>
                nothing ever seems to disturb
                <lb/>
                it" You will say I must
                <lb/>
                have changed a lot, but he
                <lb/>
                did not see very far below
                <lb/>
                the surface.

            <pb n="5" facs="#rb066e" xml:id="t1-body-pb2"/>
            
            <p>
                I am very sorry to hear
                <lb/>
                that <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>'s ringworm is so
                <lb/>
                slow in curing. When is she
                <lb/>
                going to school?
            </p>
            <p>
                Think I forgot to tell
                <lb/>
                you that the boy who did
                <lb/>
                the Anzac Christmas card I
                <lb/>
                sent <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name> was killed a few
                <lb/>
                days afterwards by a shell.
                <lb/>
                I was on the spot a few
                <lb/>
                seconds after he was hit. He
                <lb/>
                died in about half an hour.                
            </p>
            <p>
                Expect letters will be
                <lb/>
                skiwer than ever reaching
                <lb/>
                you, now that we are on
                <lb/>
                the move again, but I will
                <lb/>
                send as many postcards as
                <lb/>
                possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometime soon I hope
                <lb/>
                to be able to increase your
                <lb/>
                allowance. I get 57-p day
                <lb/>
                more now. There are many
                <lb/>
                things that are essential I
                
                <pb n="6" facs="#rb066f" xml:id="t1-body-x10-pb1"/>
                
                should have, and which up
                <lb/>
                to the present I have done
                <lb/>
                without. Things are very
                <lb/>
                expensive and are now
                <lb/>
                nearly double what they
                <lb/>
                were when we arrived in
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>. I hope you will
                <lb/>
                understand I will do my
                <lb/>
                best. My <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> holiday was
                <lb/>
                expensive, but it was that
                <lb/>
                or the hospital. Perhaps
                <lb/>
                you can't quite realise what
                <lb/>
                that fortnight meant. This
                <lb/>
                war game as we play it is
                <lb/>
                a rather strenuous game.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am feeling very well
                <lb/>
                but not absolutely up to the
                <lb/>
                marke yet. Am a little soft
                <lb/>
                but a few days hike will
                <lb/>
                soon harden me up again.
            </p>

                Yet another small adventure
                <lb/>
                has overtaken me. Arriving at
                <lb/>
                a small town where I have to
                <lb/>
                change trains, called <name type="place" ref="#ABK" key="ABK"><choice><sic>Abou Kebir</sic><corr>Abu Kabir</corr></choice></name>, I

                find to my constenation that

                as far as <name type="place" ref="#ZAG" key="ZAG">Zazazig</name> which is a large

                town but entirely Egyptian. Here
                <lb/>
                I shall have to pass the night
                <lb/>
                probably in some appalling
                <lb/>
                Egypitian hotel. At the present
                <lb/>
                time I have to wait an hour
                <lb/>
                here at <name type="place" ref="#ABK" key="ABK"><choice><sic>Abou Kebir</sic><corr>Abu Kabir</corr></choice></name>, and I am
                <lb/>
                sitting at a table outside a

                dirty Egyptian Cafe drinking
                <lb/>
                Egyptian coffee which is always
                <lb/>
                very good. There is just a

                chance I may find a goods or

                <lb/>
                will drop me at <name type="place" ref="#TEK" key="TEK">Tel el Kebir</name>,
                <lb/>
                but it is doubtful. I spent

                5 hours in <name type="place" ref="#ZAG" key="ZAG">Zazazig</name> once and
                <lb/>
                discovered a small zoo, with
                <lb/>
                two of the most magnificent
                <lb/>
                peacocks I have ever seen and
                <lb/>
                a splendid specimen of a lion,
                <lb/>
                but one cannot go reveling

                peacocks &amp; lions in the middle

                of the night and it is now
                <lb/>
                9.15.

            <p>
                There is nothing more to
                <lb/>
                tell you just now! Tomorrow
                <lb/>
                I shall only have two hours
                <lb/>
                at <name type="place" ref="#TEK" key="TEK">Tel el Kebir</name> to get my kit
                <lb/>
                together, send some back to
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> and arrange for a truck
                <lb/>
                for my hope which is there.
