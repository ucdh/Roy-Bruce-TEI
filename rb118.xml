<p rend="indent">Your letter of 26<hi rend="sup">.</hi> May has
	<lb/>arrived, praise the pigs. You will see they take
	<lb/>some time to get here these days.
</p>
<p rend="indent">I am anxious to get your next
	<lb/>which will probably give the result of your exam. Am
	<lb/>sorry you were disappointed with the paper, but you
	<lb/>will find that an exam paper never does ask the
	<lb/>questions one really knows the answer to, and then
	<lb/>one always feels <choice><sic>agrieved</sic><corr>aggrieved</corr></choice>, and looks upon it as a 
	<lb/>personal affront.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Glad to hear you are enjoying
	<lb/>your holiday, probably by the time you get this you
	<lb/>will be having another.
</p>
<p rend="indent">You have not yet enclosed any
	<lb/>of <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen's</name> tests, I should much like to see some.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Glad you liked my photographs, I
	<lb/>I am told it is a very good likeness. Probably I was
	<lb/>stouter then, at that time I was living on the fat of
	<lb/>the land at G.H.Q., in any case I have filled out a
	<lb/>lot the last four years.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Very sorry indeed to hear about <name type="person">Muir</name>,


<pb n="2" facs="#rb118b"/>

	why did they give up the farm? Surely the
	<lb/>country is better for him than the town?
</p>
<p rend="indent">Had a very nice letter from <name type="person" ref="#AWH" key="AWH">M<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="u">rs</hi></hi> Hay</name> the
	<lb/>other day, some of her remarks are most amusing.
	<lb/>She is almost the only one left who troubles to
	<lb/>write to me.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Very pleased to hear <name type="person" ref="#CHI">Chillie</name> has an M.C.
	<lb/>no doubt he deserved it. I understand that <name type="person" ref="#NIC">Nicholls</name>'
	<lb/>D.S.O. was the occasion for much ribald laughter, but 
	<lb/>as I was not there I cannot judge. So far as
	<lb/>I am concerned you need not expect to see my
	<lb/>name figuring in those lists. I have expressed
	<lb/>opinions about the promiscuous distribution of these
	<lb/>things more than once. I know of a case of a man
	<lb/>who has lived in one of the best hotels in <name type="place" ref="#ALX" key="ALX">Alexandria</name>
	<lb/>since 1914. He is employed as <add place="above">an</add> M.L.O. i.e. Military
	<lb/>landing officer. He superintended the arrival of ships
	<lb/>with troops. He was a subaltern in a cavalry regt
	<lb/>sent there because considered unsuitable for the field.
	<lb/>He is now a captain and wears the M.C. and Croix de
	<lb/>guerre, another man was awarded the Italian silver
	<lb/>medal for bravery - he sat in an office and deciphered
	<lb/>telegrams. - I see the O.B.E. is now awarded in

<pb n="3" facs="#rb118c"/>

	the field. It is called here The Order of the Bad
	<lb/>Egg! It is only those who do not know who covet
	<lb/>those things nowadays, those who do understand
	<lb/>prefer a bare breast.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Glad to hear <name type="person" ref="#EZI" key="EZI">Erling <choice><sic>Zeisler</sic><corr>Ziesler</corr></choice></name> is getting on, there
	<lb/>was always good stuff in him. Suppose he is Staff
	<lb/>Captain with one of the N.Z. Brigades. - It should
	<lb/>suit him being on the 'Q' side.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Sorry to hear you think I am not
	<lb/>treating you fairly. I suppose you realise that
	<lb/>until I am able to refund the money you had
	<lb/>from <name type="person">Scott</name>, you have made it quite impossible
	<lb/>for me to return to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name>, even supposing I could
	<lb/>get leave. Money doesn't grow on bushes here anymore
	<lb/>than it does elsewhere. If this war hasn't taught
	<lb/>you that your needs must be suited to your income
	<lb/>I don't suppose anything will. I hate writing
	<lb/>to you like this, especially as from this end one
	<lb/>never knows what is going to happen from day to day,
	<lb/>I don't know how you are going to straighten out
	<lb/>your tangle. I don't propose to pay <name type="person">Scott</name>, and it is
	<lb/>obvious I cannot return until he is paid. You
	<lb/>seem to be beginning to think I am out here for

<pb n="4" facs="#rb118d"/>

	amusement and am living a life of ease and
	<lb/>luxury. Don't you think you might try to help a
	<lb/>little. Let us look at it from another point of view.
	<lb/>Let us assume the war ends tomorrow and the army
	<lb/>is disbanded. I am not a regular soldier and I
	<lb/>return to civil life. On my return after 4 years I
	<lb/>find what. My house inhabited by strangers, my
	<lb/>daughter at a boarding school, my wife in lodgings with
	<lb/>a millstone of debt round her. It is not a pleasant
	<lb/>picture is it, but I am afraid it is a true one. Be
	<lb/>quite fair now, is it reasonable that I should return
	<lb/>to that. Put yourself in my place and try and think
	<lb/>it out.</p>
	<p rend="indent">I have many worries of my own, but
	<lb/>because I don't put them on paper it doesn't follow
	<lb/>they don't exist. This is not at all an easy life here,
	<lb/>and I want every bit of brain and energy I possess to
	<lb/>keep going - afterwards I want some rest and a
	<lb/>little peace, but I cannot see much likelihood of it
	<lb/>in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name> at present. My dear, I am afraid you are
	<lb/>like most of your sex and see things only from one
	<lb/>view point viz your own, also you are somewhat
	<lb/>selfish. I used not to think this last. There
	<lb/>I am not going to say any more now, I want you
	<lb/>to think things over quietly. I am sure you will

<pb n="5" facs="#rb118e"/>

	see that "Not treating you fairly", hardly applies
	<lb/>to me.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Here's a story:
<lb/>An officer <del rend="strike">was</del> had an operation on his hip. When
	<lb/>he recovered consciousness he asked the V.A.D. whether
	<lb/>it was a girl or a boy!
	<lb/>She fled.
	<lb/>This is true.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Have not been very fit lately, got sandfly
	<lb/>fever again, temperature 104, went to bed for 3 days,
	<lb/>they talked of hospital but I flatly refused to go and
	<lb/>am better now. Also I scratched my ankle &amp; it
	<lb/>went septic, and I can't get a boot on and most
	<lb/>things are flat stale and unprofitable. Luckily
	<lb/>things are quiet just now and Abdul is not
	<lb/>obstreperous.
</p>
<p rend="indent">We had a fortnight out of the line
	<lb/>last month, first time for 6 months, it was
	<lb/>almost like a holiday, although we were busy
	<lb/>adapting Indian Battalions to new conditions.
</p>
<p rend="indent">Sorry you think my letters are so
	<lb/>matter of fact, am afraid this is not a very

<pb n="6" facs="#rb118f"/>

	romantic life.
</p>
<p rend="indent">This may amuse you. A Jewish Battalion 
	<lb/>has been raised out here and they have adopted
	<lb/>for their motto "For (e) skin and country" also
	<lb/>"No advance without security", but I like the
	<lb/>former best don't you?
</p>
<p rend="indent">The French news is good, but it is only
	<lb/>a phase in the war. The war will eventually
	<lb/>be won in the air, when we can control the air
	<lb/>entirely then will we see everything they do &amp;
	<lb/>they will see nothing we do, then we win -
	<lb/>Think that out.
</p>
<p rend="indent">No more now, I hear there is a
	<lb/>cake for tea &amp; it is tea time.
</p>
