                Got a parcel
                <lb/>
                from you yesterday with socks,
                <lb/>
                toothbrush &amp; paste, Keatings
                <lb/>
                powder, for which my dear
                <lb/>
                many thanks, those parcels
                <lb/>
                are the joy of my life when 
                <lb/>
                they arrive particularly when
                <lb/>
                there is chocolate or pipe
                <lb/>
                tobacco in them. Chocolate
                <lb/>
                is hard to get and pipe tobacco
                <lb/>
                (Diadem) impossible. Also got
                <lb/>
                an <name type="org" ref="#AUW">Auckland Weekly</name> but no 
                <lb/>
                letters, have had not letters

                for quite a long time now,
                <lb/>
                suppose some will turn up

                think there will be much
                <lb/>
                doing for some time. I 
                <lb/>
                would not be in the least
                <lb/>
                surprised if about March
                <lb/>

                <lb/>
                that is if our friends the

                My little flash of luck
                <lb/>
                in commanding the squadron &amp;
                <lb/>
                now being second in command
                <lb/>
                seems to be fast losing its
                <lb/>
                brilliance and probably in
                <lb/>
                a week or so I shall sink
                <lb/>
                again into the semi obscurity
                <lb/>
                of a troop leader. Some of
                <lb/>
                the birds who have been having
                <lb/>
                a good time in <name type="place" ref="#ENG">England</name> for
                <lb/>
                months past are on their

                way out again, and of course
                <lb/>
                will take over their old jobs.
                <lb/>
                It will be a little hard for

                me after over three months,
                <lb/>
                but it can't be helped and I
                <lb/>
                suppose that some day the
                <lb/>
                birds will sing again. I am
                <lb/>
                still waiting for that temporary
                <lb/>
                promotion to roll along if it
                <lb/>
                does not come in the next few
                <lb/>
                days I shall lose it as the

                what a fuss was made of

                about time too. You know

                a month's correspondence
