				<salute>My dearest girl:</salute>
			</opener>
			<p>
				Have just re-
				<lb/>
				membered it is exacly 10 months
				<lb/>
				today since I enrolled in the
				<lb/>
				Expeditionary Force, nearly a year,
				<lb/>
				and what a change from the
				<lb/>
				previous 10 months of my <lb/>
				<choice><sic>exis-tance</sic><corr>existence</corr></choice>! Surely enough change &amp;
				<lb/>
				adventure to satisfy even my
				<lb/>
				restless spirit. How much longer
				<lb/>
				is it going to last? Will there be
				
				
				<pb n="2" facs="#rb042b" xml:id="t1-body-x2-pb1"/>
				
				another 10 months or shall we
				<lb/>
				all be home for Xmas. I have
				<lb/>
				just been reading an English 
				<lb/>
				paper a month old, and the
				<lb/>
				end looks as far off as ever.
				<lb/>
				What ghastly stories one reads of
				<lb/>
				these Germans! Our "friends the Turks"
				<lb/>
				are models of chivalry compared to
				<lb/>
				them. And the President of the
				<lb/>
				<name type="place" ref="#USA" key="USA">U.S.A.</name> says there is such a thing
				<lb/>
				as being too "right" to fight. Ye
				<lb/>
				gods. It is time we had a new
				<lb/>
				world or a new religion.</p>
			<p>
				Well, there is nothing much to
				<lb/>
				report about in my immediate
				<lb/>
				vicinity. Yesterday morning we
				<lb/>
				were shelled for ½ an hour &amp; the
				<lb/>
				CYC had 1 man killed &amp; 5 wounded.
				<lb/>
				Luckily I had no casualties &amp; we 
				<lb/>
				were all mixed up at the time.
				<lb/>
				<name type="person">Finlay</name>, who I think I told you
				<lb/>
				was slightly wounded in <choice><sic>head</sic><corr>the head</corr></choice> at 
				
				<pb n="3" facs="#rb042c" xml:id="t1-body-x3-pb1"/>
				
				No 2 post, got a bullet in the
				<lb/>
				leg two days ago &amp; is now in
				<lb/>
				the hospital. He says that a 
				<lb/>
				fortune teller in <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>, told him
				<lb/>
				he would be wounded twice,
				<lb/>
				taken prisoner once, but that
				<lb/>
				he would escape. He has been
				<lb/>
				wounded twice, it remains to 
				<lb/>
				be seen what happens later on.
				<lb/>
				He used to work on the Railway
				<lb/>
				at the Cave.
			</p>
			<p>
				Last night young <name type="person">Trotter Fairlie</name>
				<lb/>
				was on duty in a trench, &amp; 
				<lb/>
				<name type="person">Scott</name> <name type="person">(<unclear reason="illegible">Humino</unclear> Scott</name>'s son) was beside
				<lb/>
				him. <name type="person">Trotter</name> dropped something
				<lb/>
				down the slope behind him, &amp; <name type="person">Scott</name>
				<lb/>
				said "Dropped your cigarettes <name type="person">Trotter</name>."?
				<lb/>
				"Something like that" said <name type="person">Trotter</name>,
				<lb/>
				said <name type="person">Scott</name> "Will you give me two 
				<lb/>
				if I go and get them for you?"
				<lb/>
				"Yes" said <name type="person">Trotter</name> - <name type="person">Scott</name> climbed
				
				<pb n="4" facs="#rb042d" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
				
				down in the dark, and after a 
				<lb/>
				long search found a box of matches.
				<lb/>
				"Couldn't find your cigarettes <name type="person">Trotter</name>,
				<lb/>
				only a box of matches" said <name type="person">Scott</name>,
				<lb/>
				"Yes" said <name type="person">Trotter</name>, "that was what
				<lb/>
				I dropped", and gave him two!
			</p>
			<p>You are right about parcels
				<lb/>
				taking a long time to get here.
				<lb/>
				I don't know what happens to 
				<lb/>
				them. I finished the last of 
				<lb/>
				your coffee the other day, &amp; no 
				<lb/>
				more is procurable. However 
				<lb/>
				we are not doing so badly some-
				<lb/>
				times. I snared a tin of milk
				<lb/>
				&amp; two eggs yesterday, to say nothing
				<lb/>
				of a bottle of pickled onions. I 
				<lb/>
				am thinking of giving a dinner
				<lb/>
				party.
			</p>
			<p>Was interrupted here by
				<lb/>
				<name type="person">Jack Tonkin</name> who came over to
				<lb/>
				see me. They have only been
				
				<pb n="5" facs="#rb042e" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
				
				here a couple of days. They go
				<lb/>
				into the trenches some day this
				<lb/>
				week for their christening. He 
				<lb/>
				says Bowie &amp; Co are at <name type="place" ref="#ZEI" key="ZEI">Zeitoun</name>, so
				<lb/>
				long as they don't bring them
				<lb/>
				here there seems a chance of
				<lb/>
				our getting our horses back.
			</p>
			<p>
				<name type="person"><unclear reason="illegible">Houlker</unclear></name>has been wounded, &amp; 
				<lb/>
				there is a rumour that <name type="person"><unclear reason="illegible">Haucanow</unclear></name>
				<lb/>
				has been invalided back to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE"><choice><abbr>N.Z.</abbr><expan>New Zealand</expan></choice></name>
				<lb/>
				He was not at all well when
				<lb/>
				we left him at <name type="place" ref="#ZEI" key="ZEI">Zeitoun</name>.</p>
			
			<pb n="6" facs="#rb042f" xml:id="t1-body-pb2"/>
			
			<p>
				I am sitting up in my dug-
				<lb/>
				out in the early morning writing
				<lb/>
				this, as the mail closes at 9am,
				<lb/>
				&amp; Jack stayed to ten last night
				<lb/>
				&amp; then it got dark.
				<lb/>
				They have just commenced
				<lb/>
				shelling us to say good morning 
				<lb/>
				as it were.
				<lb/>
				Many are getting a little
				<lb/>
				"nervy", being continually subjected
				<lb/>
				to shell fire &amp; snipers. I expect
				<lb/>
				before long there will be a large
				<lb/>
				number, unless we can get
				<lb/>
				something really active to do.
				<lb/>
				That one was closer, it threw
				<lb/>
				some dust on to this letter. It 
				<lb/>
				is curious but we cannot locate 
				<lb/>
				the particular battery that does
				<lb/>
				this shelling. It is very securely
				
				<pb n="7" facs="#rb042g" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
				
				<lb/>
				hidden. They have done a lot
				<lb/>
				of damage since we have been 
				<lb/>
				here.
				<lb/>
				I hope you and old <name type="person">Perry</name>
				<lb/>
				win one of those cups, "Mademoiselle
				<lb/>
				Small feet". You have no distburbing
				<lb/>
				element in the shape of a hus-
				<lb/>
				band this time to upset your
				<lb/>
				equilibrium.
				<lb/>
				Am going out to No 1 Pish
				<lb/>
				tonight for 24 hours. Have not
				<lb/>
				been there before, but hear it
				<lb/>
				is very bad for flies.
				<lb/>
				Had a yarn with <name type="person">Jack
				<lb/>
				Rolleston</name> &amp; <name type="person">Harold Wright</name> the
				<lb/>
				other day, they are both flour-
				<lb/>
				ishing.
				<lb/>
				Don't be too strict with
				<lb/>
				<name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>, you know, do bring her up
				<lb/>
				properly. Let her have plenty of
				
				<pb n="8" facs="#rb042h" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb2"/>
				
				<lb/>
				rope. Manners &amp; speech are the
				<lb/>
				great things. Whatever you do
				<lb/>
				don't keep too tight a rein on
				<lb/>
				her. If you are always correcting
				<lb/>
				her, you will end by closing
				<lb/>
				up the flower you are so anxious
				<lb/>
				to open. But I know you are
				<lb/>
				doing well with her.
				<lb/>
				I must go now (the shelling
				<lb/>
				has stopped), have a swim &amp;
				<lb/>
				then breakfast will be ready.
				<lb/>
				Am glad <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> wrote you,
				<lb/>
				he told me he had. In fact he
				<lb/>
				wrote two letters, but was scared
				<lb/>
				of the first one &amp; tore it up.
			</p>
				<closer>
					<salute>Here is a fat kiss	.	for you
					<lb/>
					&amp; <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>, get as much out of 
					<lb/>
					life as you can, and don't worry - 
					<lb/>
					we will be together again before
					<lb/>
					you realise it. You have all my
					<lb/>
