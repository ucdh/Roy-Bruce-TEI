            <p> 
                
                I am beginning to be
                <lb/>
                afraid that my prophecies concerning our
                <lb/>
                departure for Europe early in March are not
                <lb/>
                going to be fulfilled.  It is now a matter
                <lb/>
                of equipment, they cannot get the necessary
                <lb/>
                clothing, saddlery etc for the men.  They talk
                <lb/>
                in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name> about their splendidly equipped
                <lb/>
                force, but let me assure you of all the
                <lb/>
                poverty stricken Brigades the Mounted Rifles
                <lb/>
                are about the limit and if it is any
                <lb/>
                satisfaction to the people of South Canterbury,
                <lb/>
                the South Canterbury Squadron is one of the
                <lb/>
                worst equipped.  So far as I can gather we
                <lb/>
                are the only squadron in the Brigade i.e. 
                <lb/>
                3 Regiments of 3 Squadrons each, in which the
                <lb/>
                officers did not receive a grant from their
                <lb/>
                various patriotic committees.  I will give
                <lb/>
                you a rough idea of what it has cost me
                <lb/>
                for equipment since I have been in <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>,
                <lb/>
                exclusive of what I had to buy in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand </name>.
                <lb/>
                
                Pair boots   35/-  Puttees &amp; Sundries say 40/-
                <lb/>
                2 Pairs Riding Bches 110/-    Total 286/- = £14,5/-
                <lb/>

                <pb n="2" facs="#rb026b" xml:id="t1-body-x2-pb1"/>
                
                This total does not include a revolver which
                <lb/>
                will cost £4/5, and if we stay here much
                <lb/>
                longer I shall be obliged to get 2 new light
                <lb/>
                summer uniforms &amp; corresponding under-
                <lb/>
                clothing.  Don't think I am grumbling,
                <lb/>
                because I don't mind it in the least, and
                <lb/>
                I have plenty of money to get everything I 
                <lb/>
                want, but I should just like to get some
                <lb/>
                of those smug faced local politicians out
                <lb/>
                here &amp; show them how ignorant they are
                <lb/>
                generally.  Having got that off my chest
                <lb/>
                and it is the only growl I have, not
                <lb/>
                for myself, but for the men, for when I 
                <lb/>
                think of all the money that was collected
                <lb/>
                in <name type="place" ref="#TIM" key="TIM">Timaru</name> for equipment, and how it
                <lb/>
                has been frittered away it is worth a
                <lb/>
                little grumble occasionally.  I will go
                <lb/>
                on to something more pleasant.
            </p>  
            <p>
                We went out digging trenches in
                <lb/>
                the dark the other night and quite amused
                <lb/>
                ourselves.  This week there is a contemplated
                <lb/>
                5 days trek from here to a place called
                <lb/>
                Zag-a-zig about 40 miles from here.  You
                <lb/>
                may be able to find it on the maps.  It
                <lb/>
                should be quite a good expedition.  The
                <lb/>
                Brigadier says we will take as much
                
                <pb n="3" facs="#rb026c" xml:id="t1-body-x3-pb1"/>
                
                ammunition as possible &amp; get as near to the
                <lb/>
                Turks as we can, but alas the Turks are
                <lb/>
                many miles away at present.
            </p>
            <p>
                The weather is superb, no rain yet,
                <lb/>
                and cloudless sunny days &amp; cool starlit
                <lb/>
                nights.  It is however gradually getting
                <lb/>
                warmer, and I am told that next month
                <lb/>
                the dust storms begin.
            </p>

                <name type="person" ref="#AND">Andrews</name> is well and is enjoying
                <lb/>
                himself in sundry ways.  He expresses himself 
                <lb/>
                thus:  "If this is war, to h-l with peace" -
                <lb/>
                which is quite expressive of the present situation.

            <p>
                
                Oh: by the way, you know the Biblical
                <lb/>
                story of <name type="person" ref="#POT">Potiphar</name>'s wife &amp; <name type="person" ref="#JOS">Joseph</name>; well it appears
                <lb/>
                the other day they discovered the mummy 
                <lb/>
                of <name type="person" ref="#POT">Potiphar</name>'s wife, and you must know that
                <lb/>
                as a rule all mummies have a papyrus or
                <lb/>
                some record or something rolled up in their
                <lb/>
                hands, well, on opening the hand of Potiphar's
                <lb/>
                wife instead of finding the usual scroll, they 
                <lb/>
                were surprised to find the tail of a shirt
                <lb/>
                with J marked on it.!!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am gradually collecting some small
                <lb/>
                articles of Egyptian make which I will send
                <lb/>
                you in a box before we leave here.  They are
                <lb/>
                perforce not valuable but they are Egyptian or 
                <lb/>
                Arabian.  The cat I have not yet been

                able to secure, but I am living in hopes.
                <lb/>
                You shall have something mummified
                <lb/>
                anyway.

                I have made the aquaintance
                <lb/>
                of a Grecian family here named Okonomoupolos,
                <lb/>
                the old bird is the architect for the Egyptian
                <lb/>
                State Railways, two of his daughters came 
                <lb/>
                out here selling badges for the Belgian Relief
                <lb/>
                Fund, I helped them along with French &amp; then
                <lb/>
                they brought their father out.  I spent the
                <lb/>
                evening at their flat last week.  One commences
                <lb/>
                about 10 o'clock &amp; songs &amp; dancing go on till
                <lb/>
                about two o'clock in the morning.  I had a
                <lb/>
                very pleasant evening.  There are some friends
                <lb/>
                of theirs named Sakkakicia, Italian Jews
                <lb/>
                I think, who are also very nice &amp; hospitable.
                <lb/>
                One meets all nationalities at their flats, all
                <lb/>
                can speak French but only a few men speak
                <lb/>
                English at all, the women at the most only
                <lb/>
                know a few words.  <name type="person" ref="#BLA">Blair</name>, <name type="person" ref="#GUN">Guthrie</name> &amp; I had

                <lb/>
                on Saturday &amp; the cackle of high pitched
                <lb/>
                voices all talking at once was quite funny.

                poor child it has not gone so quickly for
