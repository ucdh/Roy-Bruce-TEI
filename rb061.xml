            <p>
                Much jubilation in
                <lb/>
                dugout land, I got 6 <del rend="strike">5 f</del> letters from you
                <lb/>
                in the last 3 days after receiving none
                <lb/>
                for over a month. I was glad to get
                <lb/>
                them, and to know that you and <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>
                <lb/>
                were both well and as happy as possible.
                <lb/>
                I also got one from <name type="person" ref="#AHU" key="AHU">Alice Hursthouse</name>, which
                <lb/>
                was rather curious considering I had written
                <lb/>
                to her only the week before.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am going to try and write you a
                <lb/>
                decent letter this time, and answer yours in
                <lb/>
                turn if it takes me a week to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin - your first letter dated <date when="1915-09-29"><choice><abbr>Sept<hi rend="u"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi></abbr><expan>September</expan></choice> 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi></date>
                <lb/>
                by the way one is numbered 43, three numbered
                <lb/>
                44 &amp; two numbered 46. Your numbers are
                <lb/>
                somewhat out, but it does not matter
                <lb/>
                because I cannot keep track of them very
                <lb/>
                easily. You seem to have been having
                
                <pb n="2" facs="#rb061b" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
                
                a somewhat strenuous time between the
                <lb/>
                nurse and the cooking, but don't worry
                <lb/>
                take it as easily as possible. Take comfort
                <lb/>
                in the thought that you are just as
                <lb/>
                useful there as anywhere else at the
                <lb/>
                present time. It is all part of the game.            
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't worry too much about <name type="person" ref="#JHA" key="JHA">Jean</name>, she
                <lb/>
                will very likely get better. I know what
                <lb/>
                it must be with all of you there; in
                <lb/>
                these times of death and uncertainty
                <lb/>
                always remember that there are many
                <lb/>
                thousands of others (I don't mean here, I
                <lb/>
                mean homes) who have suffered and are
                <lb/>
                suffering far more than you are. Remember
                <lb/>
                that &amp; be thankful that you are not where
                <lb/>
                massacres are taking place, that your homes
                <lb/>
                are not in ruins and that you do not have
                <lb/>
                to look for shelter. These things are accepted
                <lb/>
                more of less as part of their heritage by all
                <lb/>
                European nations, and are naturally note
                <lb/>
                well realised or understood by Australasians
                <lb/>
                owing to the geographic situation and the

                peaceful existance always led by those countries.

            <p>
                Where the Hamiltons got the idea
                <lb/>
                that I was going clerical work beats me
                <lb/>
                altogether. Truly rumour is a strange thing.

                Here, none of the "useless old crock"
                <lb/>
                cry of yours, buck up and look after yourself,
                <lb/>
                if you are not looking 10 years younger
                <lb/>
                when I come back there will be a row.
                <lb/>
                I shall be the useless old crock, you are to
                <lb/>
                be the young &amp; beautiful peri. By the way
                <lb/>
                just to annoy you and make you consider
                <lb/>
                what you had better do about it, I will
                <lb/>
                tell you a deadly secret, that, at the
                <lb/>
                present moment I was never before in better
                <lb/>
                health, or felt younger or more idiotic, that
                <lb/>
                I am eating like a horse &amp; sleeping like a
                <lb/>
                bear, and that except for losing a far more
                <lb/>
                hairs from the top of my head I haven't
                <lb/>
                looked younger for about 12 years. There, just
                <lb/>
                think that over quietly and tell me what
                <lb/>
                right you have to call yourself a "useless old
                <lb/>
                crock". Since I have been here this time
                <lb/>
                I have actually just put on weight. I hope

                this won't send you tearing into James' to

                buy aids to beauty! You don't need them,
                <lb/>
                but dear old thing do please look after
                <lb/>
                your hands. Here endeth your first letter.
                <lb/>
                Your next dated <date when="1915-10-01">1<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="u">st</hi></hi> October</date> is a little more
                <lb/>
                cheerful. I cannot understand why you
                <lb/>
                have not received any from me, I wrote
                <lb/>
                three from <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name> and I think three
                <lb/>
                while I was in <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>. You seem only
                <lb/>
                to have received one from <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name> &amp; one
                <lb/>
                from <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>; perhaps the others have
                <lb/>
                turned up by now.

                Sorry you did not see <name type="person" ref="#NIC" key="NIC">Nicholls</name>, I

                am wondering what lot he is coming

                with.
            </p>
            <p>
                Glad you are getting that Building
                <lb/>
                Society money at last, just use it as you

                Your remarks about the war are
                <lb/>
                very good, your ideas are the same as
                <lb/>
                mine, so far as they go. I think before
                <lb/>
                you get this letter several things will
                <lb/>
                have happened. Has it ever occured to you

                that the <name type="place" ref="#GAP" key="GAP">Gallipoli penninsula</name> has now lost
                <lb/>
                its strategical importance. I discussed
                <lb/>
                the point with <name type="person" ref="#AND" key="AND">Andrews</name> at <name type="place" ref="#LEM" key="LEM">Lemnos</name> 6
                <lb/>
                weeks ago and we both held the same
                <lb/>
                views.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should like to see <name type="person">Helen</name> &amp; <name type="person">Dickson</name>
                <lb/>
                together now. Give the old chap my
                <lb/>
                regards &amp; tell him I have every confidence
                <lb/>
                in his ability to look after her, or hers to
                <lb/>
                look after him.
            </p>
            <p>
                You must not blame the authorities
                <lb/>
                too much for sending wrong reports &amp; for
                <lb/>
                mails going astray, they are up against
                <lb/>
                a very big proposition here, and they all
                <lb/>
                work their hardest and do their best.
                <lb/>
                No one who has not been here can
                <lb/>
                accurately gauge what is required of them.
                <lb/>
                To me, it is extraordinary that there
                <lb/>
                are not more mistakes made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Am looking forward to getting a
                <lb/>
                parcel from you before Christmas. They are
                <lb/>
                so welcome, a whole lot came yesterday
                
                <pb n="6" facs="#rb061f" xml:id="t1-body-x13-pb1"/>
                
                but there was nothing for me. Chocolate,
                <lb/>
                sweets, cakes in tins, an occasional pipe etc,
                <lb/>
                all those things help us along very materially.
                <lb/>
                Your next letter is dated <date when="1915-10-10">October 10<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="u">th</hi></hi></date>, there
                <lb/>
                is not a great deal to answer, but it
                <lb/>
                sounds cheerful and that is the great
                <lb/>
                thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am glad <name type="person">Barney</name> &amp; <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name> are
                <lb/>
                getting on well together, there is no

                reason why they shouldn't.

                Your next dated <date when="1915-10-12">12 October</date>, is a postscript
                <lb/>
                saying you have a letter of mine from
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name>. Am glad the photos arrived,
                <lb/>
                but sorry the postcards did not, some were
                <lb/>
                quite good ones. How <name type="person" ref="#CHI" key="CHI">Chilton's</name> <choice><abbr>P.C</abbr><expan>postcard</expan></choice> to
                <lb/>
                <name type="person" ref="#JHA" key="JHA">Jean</name> got in is a complete mystery as
                <lb/>
                those photos were posted in <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name> before I
                <lb/>
                left and <name type="person" ref="#CHI" key="CHI">Chillie</name> has never been near
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#CYP" key="CYP">Cyprus</name>!
            </p>
            <p>
                You are quite right about the <name type="place" ref="#DAN" key="DAN">Dar-
				<lb/>
				danelles</name>, although perhaps <del rend="strike">so</del> not quite so
                <lb/>
                needless sacrifices as you imagine. You
                
                <pb n="7" facs="#rb061g" xml:id="t1-body-x16-pb1"/>
                
                must remember that in the first instance
                <lb/>
                it was necessary to open the <name type="place" ref="#DAN" key="DAN">Dardanelles</name> to
                <lb/>
                help <name type="place" ref="#RUS" key="RUS">Russia</name>. It was not possible at the
                <lb/>
                time owing to a miscalculation, and
                <lb/>
                now <name type="place" ref="#RUS" key="RUS">Russia</name> is able to help herself. Had
                <lb/>
                we been able to do it as we intended,
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#WAR" key="WAR">Warsaw</name> would not have fallen. That is
                <lb/>
                one of the reasons why I say this place
                <lb/>
                has lost its importance, another reason is
                <lb/>
                that the base of operations has shifted.

                only natural - surely <name type="person" ref="#CHI" key="CHI">Chillie</name> knows. It is
                <lb/>
                curious because only a little time ago he
                
                <pb n="8" facs="#rb061h" xml:id="t1-body-x18-pb1"/>
                
                was talking of bringing her to <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>. We
                <lb/>
                have heard no news of him since he left
                <lb/>
                here, and have no idea where he is nor
                <lb/>
                what is the matter with him.

                Those teeth of yours seem to be taking
                <lb/>
                a long time, surely they ought to be nearly
                <lb/>
                finished?
            </p>
            <p>
                I told you in one of my letters that
                <lb/>
                I had destroyed your Dream <choice><abbr>M.S.</abbr><expan>manuscript</expan></choice> I can't
                <lb/>
                do anything with it here, and I can't
                <lb/>
                carry it about with me. I never showed
                <lb/>
                it to anyone, there was noone to show it
                <lb/>
                to.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don;t agree with you that it was
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#GER" key="GER">Germany</name>'s avowed plan to strike down
                <lb/>
                through <name type="place" ref="#SER" key="SER"><choice><sic resp="#LJW">Servia</sic><corr>Serbia</corr></choice></name> on to <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> &amp; <name type="place" ref="#IND" key="IND">India</name>, that
                <lb/>
                only came after she had failed to break
                <lb/>
                through on the Western &amp; Eastern fronts.
                <lb/>
                Had she done so at first, &amp; been content
                <lb/>
                to hold the Western &amp; Eastern fronts, I
                <lb/>
                think the tale we should have to tell
                <lb/>
                now would be a very different one,
                
                <pb n="9" facs="#rb061i" xml:id="t1-body-x21-pb1"/>
                
                because she would have succeeded &amp; we
                <lb/>
                should now be fighting in <name type="place" ref="#IND" key="IND">India</name> instead
                <lb/>
                of <name type="place" ref="#TUR" key="TUR">Turkey</name>. She miscalculated at the
                <lb/>
                first the resisting power of <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name>, <name type="place" ref="#FRA" key="FRA">France</name>,

            <p>
                Thanks very much dear for your
                <lb/>
                cherry messages, I have got over all my
                <lb/>
                despondency now, as you will doubtless
                <lb/>
                have gathered from my more recent
                <lb/>
                letters, nevertheless it is nice to know
                <lb/>
                you are so plucky over everything. I
                <lb/>
                was rather down in <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name>, I think
                <lb/>
                reaction &amp; strain more than anything
                <lb/>
                else, and I had to let myself 'go' once
                <lb/>
                once or twice, and it was some 'go'. Details
                <lb/>
                verbally, sometime in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Haven't had any papers from you
                <lb/>
                for a long time, but I have seen all
                
                <pb n="10" facs="#rb061j" xml:id="t1-body-x24-pb1"/>
                
                the latest ones from the others.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't fret yourself about not being
                <lb/>
                able to write for a time. Your turn
                <lb/>
                will come alright. Hurry up and get
                <lb/>
                a cook, and go back to your own home. I
                <lb/>
                always think from your letters you are
                <lb/>
                really happier there than at <name type="place" ref="#ROL" key="ROL">'Rollesby'</name>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you leave "Jeremy" behind now
                <lb/>
                when you go away? Who looks after him?
            </p>
            <p>
                That, I think, ends your letters, &amp;
                <lb/>
                now I will start and tell you of a
                <lb/>
                few odd things about here; though there
                <lb/>
                is not much to say.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all there has been a change
                <lb/>
                in the command of the regiment. <name type="person" ref="#CPO" key="CPO">Major 
                    <lb/>
                    Powles</name> who was our Brigade Major from
                <lb/>
                the beginning has taken over from <name type="person" ref="#JST" key="JST">Major
                    <lb/>
                    Studholme</name> (who has not had much experience!)
                <lb/>
                and they did not return <name type="person" ref="#JST" key="JST">Major Studholme</name>
                <lb/>
                to the command of the 8<hi rend="u"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi> but made
                <lb/>
                him acting 2<hi rend="u"><hi rend="sup">nd</hi></hi> in command &amp; in charge

                of digging operations for winter quarters!
                <lb/>
                He can do no harm and fusses round
                <lb/>
                with a tape measure all day. I
                <lb/>
                was awfully afraid he would take over
                <lb/>
                the squadron from me. <name type="person" ref="#CPO" key="CPO">Major Powles</name>
                <lb/>
                is a soldier, &amp; things are very different.            
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also heard confidentially that
                <lb/>
                I have been recommended for promotion
                <lb/>
                to the rank of captain (temporary) that is
                <lb/>
                that it will lask as long as I command
                <lb/>
                the 8<hi rend="u"><hi rend="sup">th</hi></hi>, which is not likely to be very
                <lb/>
                long now, as some of the others are bound
                <lb/>
                to be back before long. Anyway, although
                <lb/>
                not permanent it is a step in the
                <lb/>
                right direction, and apparently I have
                <lb/>
                not made a mess of the squadrom since
                <lb/>
                I took it over. Don't get excited because
                <lb/>
                it is really nothing, and I haven't event
                <lb/>
                got the temporary rank yet. Of course I
                <lb/>
                will not be able to increase your
                
                <pb n="12" facs="#rb061l" xml:id="t1-body-x29-pb1"/>
                
                allowance even if it does come off, because
                <lb/>
                it may not last any time, but if I can
                <lb/>
                I will send along a small cheque.

                Just had a most delectable after-
                <lb/>
                noon tea - yesterday when the mail
                <lb/>
                arrived there were a lot of parcels
                <lb/>
                without any names to them so they
                <lb/>
                were divided, <name type="person" ref="#MTS" key="MTS">Mathias</name> &amp; I collared a
                <lb/>
                lovely plum cake in a sealed tin (they
                <lb/>
                are very welcome) &amp; a packet of china tea.
                <lb/>
                Image it, plum cake &amp; chine tea &amp;
                <lb/>
                shells all round.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not chronicling the various
                <lb/>
                interruptions, they are too numerous, but
                <lb/>
                now it is tea time and for the present
                <lb/>
                I must depart.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tea is over, the trench line is
                <lb/>
                posted and made as secure as possible
                <lb/>
                for the night, I have lit my fire and
                <lb/>
                a pipe and with luck can settle down

                for an hour to continue this yarn, I
                <lb/>
                don't know what is wrong with me but
                <lb/>
                for the first time for many moons I feel
                <lb/>
                in the mood for writing.            
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time it is rather
                <lb/>
                curious that an order has just come in
                <lb/>
                that until further notice no more letters
                <lb/>
                will be received at the post office which
                <lb/>
                means I shall probably have to carry
                <lb/>
                this about in my pocket for some days
                <lb/>
                perhaps weeks, it also means - many
                <lb/>
                things - which you will probably know
                <lb/>
                long before you get this.
            </p>
            <p>
                You always ask me to tell you
                <lb/>
                everything about myself, doings etc, well
                <lb/>
                dear it is very hard to do because one
                <lb/>
                day is so like another in this place.
                <lb/>
                My diary has suffered sadly lately, although
                <lb/>
                I still have the record of the early days
                <lb/>
                here. When I can get an opportunity I
                <lb/>
                will send you the diary. It is contained
                
                <pb n="14" facs="#rb061n" xml:id="t1-body-x34-pb1"/>
                
                in a Field Correspondence book and written
                <lb/>
                from the back. The other part of the book
                <lb/>
                contains a lot of notes, orders, etc, which
                <lb/>
                will probably be Greek to you, but from
                <lb/>
                which you may be able to gather scraps
                <lb/>
                of information. When I can get it away
                <lb/>
                of course I have no idea, but it may reach
                <lb/>
                you by post someday if I do not bring it
                <lb/>
                myself.

                Life here now is not nearly so
                <lb/>
				strenuous as it was before, we can breathe,
                <lb/>
                formerly we had no room to do that, also
                <lb/>
                we are much better fed, getting all kinds
                <lb/>
                of little luxuries such as raisins, bread, &amp;
                <lb/>
                even a tin of butter appeared the other
                <lb/>
                day. Consequently everyone has a chance
                <lb/>
                of keeping much fitter. The weather has
                <lb/>
                been very mild since the blizzard, and
                <lb/>
                long may it continue so.

				everything, and I stuck here until had
				<lb/>
				no strength left to continue.
            </p>
			<p>
				When we meet you will probably find
				<lb/>
				many changes, I think I take my sorrows
				<lb/>
				more sadly and my pleasures more madly,
				<lb/>
				but as I said in an earlier part of this
				<lb/>
				letter I don't feel any older than I ever
				<lb/>
				have done, which sounds absurd but isn't.
			</p>
			<p>
				Have just been out to say goodbye to
				<lb/>
				<name type="person" ref="#JAT" key="JAT">Jack Tennant</name>, who you will remember used
				<lb/>
				to be in the Bank, he was one of the old
				
				<pb n="16" facs="#rb061p" xml:id="t1-body-x38-pb1"/>
				
				hands and is now a Sergeant. Like most
				<lb/>
				of them he has not been well and is
				<lb/>
				now being sent to the Hospital. One by one 
				<lb/>
				they are dropping away.
			</p>
			<p>
				I do wish <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name> could have
				<lb/>
				seen the <name type="organisation" ref="#CMR"><choice><abbr>C.M.R</abbr><expan>Canterbury Mounted Rifles</expan></choice></name> when we left <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> in
				<lb/>
				May last over 500 strong, trained to the last
				<lb/>
				minute, the equal of any troops ever raised.
				<lb/>
				I am not boasting, I am merely stating 
				<lb/>
				a quiet fact - and four months later when
				<lb/>
				we left <name type="place" ref="#GAP" key="GAP">the Peninsula</name> one officer (<name type="person">Gibbs</name> the 
				<lb/>
				signaller) &amp; 32 men.
			</p>
			<p>
				I came across a <name type="place" ref="#DAN" key="DAN">Dardanelles</name> number
				<lb/>
				of the Weekly Press, and in turning idly
				<lb/>
				over the pages I suddenly saw you in the 
				<lb/>
				centre of a full page picture watching some 
				<lb/>
				infantry go by at <name type="place" ref="#ADD" key="ADD">Addington</name>. Have you
				<lb/>
				seen it? Your face is turned away &amp; <name type="person" ref="#EEH" key="EEH">your
				<lb/>
				mother</name> &amp; I think <name type="person" ref="#AHA" key="AHA">M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Harper</name> &amp; <name type="person" ref="#GHA" key="GHA">Gordon Harper</name>
				<lb/>
				are standing beside you close to a car. It
				<lb/>
				gave me quite a shock. Probably you have
				<lb/>
				sent the "Press" to me, and it has not
				
				<pb n="17" facs="#rb061q" xml:id="t1-body-x40-pb1"/>
				
				yet arrived.
			</p>
			<p>
				Did I tell you the field glasses the 
				<lb/>
				<choice><abbr>S.C.</abbr><expan>South Canterbury</expan></choice> Club gave me have become almost useless - 
				<lb/>
				one of the prisms has slipped &amp; one gets a 
				<lb/>
				double picture of everything. I took them to
				<lb/>
				a place in <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> when I was there last &amp;
				<lb/>
				got them mended, but I don't think they
				<lb/>
				thoroughly understood them and they soon
				<lb/>
				went wrong again. They have had some
				<lb/>
				very severe handling and I don't wonder at
				<lb/>
				them going wrong. At the present time I
				<lb/>
				am using <name type="person" ref="#CHI" key="CHI">Chillie</name>'s, he left them when he
				<lb/>
				went away. The watch that Howden &amp; Innes
				<lb/>
				Jones gave me when I went away is still
				<lb/>
				going well, although I have worn out two 
				<lb/>
				leather wristlets on it and the outer case
				<lb/>
				is rusted through at the back. Actually
				<lb/>
				the same glass still remains in it.
				<lb/>
				The little valise is nearly in pieces, my
				<lb/>
				sleeping <add place='above'>bag</add> is lost (but I have another) also several
				<lb/>
				other articles are lost, my old tunic that used
				<lb/>
				to be so smart was in rags &amp; covered with 
				
				<pb n="18" facs="#rb061r" xml:id="t1-body-x41-pb1"/>
				
				blood so I threw it away. All my original
				<lb/>
				clothes, I think with the exception of an odd
				<lb/>
				shirt or so are now no more.
			</p>
			<p>
				What a life this is, death all around, 
				<lb/>
				graves in every gully, one walks about day
				<lb/>
				&amp; night with one's life in one's hands and
				<lb/>
				yet I am well and dare I say it - happy.
				<lb/>
				Truly man is a queer beast.
			</p>
			<p>
				This my dear brings me to the end of
				<lb/>
				my letter for tonight. The fire is low, my
				<lb/>
				supply of timber is nearly exhausted &amp; I
				<lb/>
				must look round the trenches before I turn
				<lb/>
				in for a few hours. I get up at 5.45, we
				<lb/>
				stand to arms before daylight as the Turks
				<lb/>
				usually choose that time for attacking, also 
				<lb/>
				I usually prowl round during the night.
			</p>
			<closer>
				Good night sweetheart, kiss <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>
				<lb/>
				for me, and a very tender one for you dear.
				<lb/>
				God bless you both.
