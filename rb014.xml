	My narrative
	<lb/>
has come to a sudden con-
    <lb/>
clusion owing to the fact
    <lb/>
that we have been requested,
    <lb/>
not to give any information
    <lb/>
regarding our whereabouts,
    <lb/>
ports of call, destination etc.
    <lb/>
There is no censorship so far
    <lb/>
on letters to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z.</name>, and I
    <lb/>
have no doubt that a great
    <lb/>
many will send full &amp;
    <lb/>
detailed accounts of our voyage,
    <lb/>
and probably you will hear
    <lb/>
far fuller accounts of things than I will send you.
</p>

<pb n="2" facs="#rb014b" xml:id="t1-body-pb2"/>

<p> 
Nothing of any importance
    <lb/>
happened from our last port
    <lb/>
of call until yesterday. You
    <lb/>
will probably have already
    <lb/>
heard this but perhaps not
    <lb/>
full particulars.

At 7.30am wireless signals
    <lb/>
for help, were picked up from
    <lb/>
<name type="place" ref="#COC" key="COC">Cocos Islands</name> and H.M.S. Sydney
    <lb/>
immediately went off at top.
    <lb/>
Great excitement everywhere
    <lb/>
especially when about 10.30. am. 
    <lb/>
another cruiser suddenly
    <lb/>
turned &amp; went off as fast as
    <lb/>
she could. Although the
    <lb/>
cruiser was 3 to 4 miles away
    <lb/>
you could see the excitement
    <lb/>
on board. They were doing

<pb n="3" facs="#rb014c" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>

all they knew, burning coal,
    <lb/>
oil, sides of bacon etc. to make
    <lb/>
her go faster (I won't swear
    <lb/>
to the sides of bacon), however
    <lb/>
before she got out of sight she
    <lb/>
came back again, having
    <lb/>
received a message to this
    <lb/>
effect:-  "Enemy has stranded
    <lb/>
herself to avoid sinking.
    <lb/>
Enemy was the Emden"
    <lb/>
That is all we know about
    <lb/>
it at present. The whole
    <lb/>
engagement was over before
    <lb/>
11 o'clock. It took the Sydney
    <lb/>
somewhat less than 3½ hours
    <lb/>
to go 40 miles &amp; smash up
    <lb/>
the Emden. Casualties 2 killed

<pb n="4" facs="#rb014d" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb2"/>

13 wounded. It was an
    <lb/>
extraordinary piece of luck
    <lb/>
that the S.O.S (help) signals
    <lb/>
sent at random from Cocos
    <lb/>
should be picked up by us
    <lb/>
just as we were abreast those
    <lb/>
islands. They of course had
    <lb/>
no idea there was anyone in
    <lb/>
the vicinity; it was just a
    <lb/>
shot in the dark.

<p rend="indent">
I was inoculated against
    <lb/>
typhoid the other day, &amp; spent
    <lb/>
a rotten day in consequence,
    <lb/>
felt just like influenza but
    <lb/>
soon passed away. Some of
    <lb/>
the men were ill for several
    <lb/>
days, and others only had a
    <lb/>
stiff arm for a few hours.

<name type="person">Pinkie</name> had a rotten time for

now.

We are very close to the
    <lb/>
Equator and the heat is
    <lb/>
intense, partly because we
    <lb/>
are travelling so slowly &amp;
    <lb/>
partly because what breeze
    <lb/>
there is is behind us.
    <lb/>
I sleep on deck every night,
    <lb/>
it is the only possible place.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
The sea is very calm and
    <lb/>
a beautiful blue, the pretty
    <lb/>
little flying fishes fairly
    <lb/>
numerous, and if we hadn't
    <lb/>
so many horses on board &amp;
    <lb/>
didn't have to shut up all
    <lb/>
the portholes at night, it would

<pb n="6" facs="#rb014f" xml:id="t1-body-x7-pb1"/>

be a delightful trip, in any
    <lb/>
case it is not so bad.

We have had no war
    <lb/>
news since we left our last
    <lb/>
port, with the exception of
    <lb/>    
<name type="place" ref="#BRI" key="BRI">Britain</name> declaring war on
    <lb/>
<name type="place" ref="#TUR" key="TUR">Turkey</name> (your dream is coming

About a week ago, a
    <lb/>
large liner passed right up
    <lb/>
our lines crowded with
    <lb/>
passengers. Little things like
    <lb/>
that are very exciting now-
    <lb/>
adays &amp; help to break the
    <lb/>
monotony in a wonderful
    <lb/>
manner, we talked of
    <lb/>
nothing else for at least two
    <lb/>
hours.

The following wireless has
    <lb/>
just this moment come in.
    <lb/>
"Sydney will rejoin as soon
    <lb/>
as all German prisoners are
    <lb/>
on board, may take 24 hours".
    <lb/>
This afternoon we are exercising
    <lb/>
horses. Perhaps that sounds
    <lb/>
rather impossible but we
    <lb/>
walk them in a single file
	<lb/>
around the saloon deck, it
	<lb/>
makes a noise and a mess
	<lb/>
but is very good for them. My
	<lb/>
horses which are down in
	<lb/>
No 3 hold can be exercised
	<lb/>
at any time without dis-
	<lb/>
turbing anyone else, provided
	<lb/>
the sea is calm, and in

<pb n="8" facs="#rb014h" xml:id="t1-body-x10-pb1"/>

consequence they are fitter
	<lb/>
than any horses in the ship.
	<lb/>
They are in a freezing chamber,
	<lb/>
and in very hot weather such
	<lb/>
as we are experiencing at
	<lb/>
present we get the refrigerator
	<lb/>
turned on a little &amp; it
	<lb/>
cools the air beautifully.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
This morning we did some
	<lb/>
shooting by towing a target
	<lb/>
astern.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
There is one little thing
	<lb/>
I regret &amp; that is that I did
	<lb/>
not bring any thin trousers
	<lb/>
with me, these saddle tweeds
	<lb/>
are very hot.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
There are a good many

<pb n="9" facs="#rb014i" xml:id="t1-body-x13-pb1"/>

cases of measles on board, between
	<lb/>
50 &amp; 60, but fortunately they
	<lb/>
are all of a mild type, &amp;
	<lb/>
the men quickly recover.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
We are not allowed to send
	<lb/>
any more copies of the "Athenic
	<lb/>
Lyre" away from the ship. I
	<lb/>
am not quite sure why.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
Boxing is very popular
	<lb/>
amongst the men, &amp; we
	<lb/>
spend what spare time we
	<lb/>
have boxing &amp; skipping. Just
	<lb/>
now it is almost too hot for
	<lb/>
amusements of that description,
	<lb/>
but there is still a good
	<lb/>
deal done.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
We still have lectures in
	<lb/>
the evening, and they are

<pb n="10" facs="#rb014j" xml:id="t1-body-x16-pb1"/>

very interesting.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
Personally I am keeping
	<lb/>
very fit and enjoying life
	<lb/>
generally, but if this heat
	<lb/>
continues much longer I
	<lb/>
shall only be a grease mark.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
I wonder whether I shall
	<lb/>
hear from you at the next
	<lb/>
port, I do hope so, it seems
	<lb/>
in many ways such a very
	<lb/>
long time since we left, &amp;
	<lb/>
yet in other ways the time
	<lb/>
has passed very quickly. I
	<lb/>
do so hope the time is
	<lb/>
passing well with you dear,
	<lb/>
and that you do not find
	<lb/>
it hanging too heavily on

<pb n="11" facs="#rb014k" xml:id="t1-body-x18-pb1"/>

your hands. I hope you
	<lb/>
will get interested in
	<lb/>
something during the summer,
	<lb/>
if you cannot play golf.
	<lb/>
On what links I wonder will
	<lb/>
our next game together be
	<lb/>
played.
</p>
<p rend="indent">
Afternoon tea has just
	<lb/>
come in and as we do not
	<lb/>
reach our next port for some
	<lb/>
days yet I will continue
	<lb/>
this later.

it also adds that letters

I am going to send this

the same time I will

We crossed the Line
	<lb/>
today, and Father<lb/>
Neptune &amp; his wives &amp;
	<lb/>
myrmidons came on board,
	<lb/>
&amp; proceeded to deal it
	<lb/>
out in time honoured
	<lb/>
custom. A large bath
	<lb/>
was rigged up in a sail

<pb n="13" facs="#rb014m" xml:id="t1-body-x21-pb1"/>

and a tip up chair beside
	<lb/>
it, then one man
	<lb/>
shaved the unfortunate
	<lb/>
one, another extracted a
	<lb/>
tooth, another gave him
	<lb/>
a pill &amp; finally he was
	<lb/>
tipped into the bath
	<lb/>
and ducked. We who
	<lb/>
had crossed the line on
	<lb/>
a previous occasion fondly
	<lb/>
imagined we were safe,
	<lb/>
but nothing of the sort,
	<lb/>
the opportunity was too
	<lb/>
good a one to lose &amp;
	<lb/>
We were all indiscriminately
	<lb/>
shaved &amp; ducked. It was

<pb n="14" facs="#rb014n" xml:id="t1-body-x21-pb2"/>

all very funny &amp; greatly
	<lb/>
enjoyed by the men.
	<lb/>
The costumes of Father
	<lb/>
Neptune &amp; his wife,
	<lb/>
especially his wife were
	<lb/>
very good.
</p>
<p>
I saw a funny
	<lb/>
sight the other morning,
	<lb/>
I was walking along the
	<lb/>
deck &amp; came to a large
	<lb/>
tub of water, but all
	<lb/>
that was sticking out
	<lb/>
was a head, two hands
	<lb/>
&amp; a book. A man was
	<lb/>
sitting in it, full of
	<lb/>
water, reading &amp; perfectly

<pb n="15" facs="#rb014o" xml:id="t1-body-x22-pb1"/>

happy. He was probably
	<lb/>
the coolest man on the
	<lb/>
ship at the time.

The men arranged
	<lb/>
an open air concert last

night, and there were

some jolly good items.

A quartette were especially

good.

	<lb/>
in a tropical shower

We danced about on

the Marconi deck without

even fig leaves for about
