        In a new dugout overlooking the 
        <lb/>
        sea. <date when="1915-05-31">Monday 31st May 1915</date>.
      </dateline>
      <lb/>
      <salute>My dearest <name type="person" ref="#MGB" key="MGB">girl</name>:</salute>
    </opener>
    
    <p>
      
      Had a letter from
      <lb/>
      Nan the other day just after you
      
      had left, also a Weekly Press. I
      <lb/>
      was awfully glad to hear from
      <lb/>
      her and to know that you &amp;<name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>
      <lb/>
      were both so bright &amp; well. She
      <lb/>
      seemed awfully pleased to have
      <lb/>
      had you there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      We moved the other day
      <lb/>
      &amp; wow I am living on the top
      <lb/>
      of a cliff overlooking the sea &amp; an
      <lb/>
      island. It is a lovely position,
      <lb/>
      my little dugout, is most picturesque,
      
      <pb n="2" facs="#rb040b" xml:id="t1-body-x3-pb1"/>
      
      surrounded by scrub with a
      <lb/>
      sort of leafy arch in front to keep
      <lb/>
      the oil-sheet up. We have had
      <lb/>
      no more rain luckily, but the sun 
      <lb/>
      is getting very hot &amp; in the middle
      <lb/>
      of the day it is very trying.
    </p>
    
    <p>      
      Was out at No 2 post the
      <lb/>
      other day again &amp; got some more
      <lb/>
      shelling, only this time not from
      <lb/>
      our own ships but the enemy.
      <lb/>
      We were not very lucky, had
      <lb/>
      two men wounded, <name type="person">Corpl. Wright</name>,
      <lb/>
      my best signaller, with shrapnel
      <lb/>
      in the arm &amp; <name type="person" ref="#JFI" key="JFI"><choice><sic>Finlay</sic><corr>Findlay</corr></choice></name> slightly in
      <lb/>
      the head . I also had another man
      <lb/>
      wounded whilst bathing on the
      <lb/>
      beach, <name type="person">Dunford</name> by name, he was
      <lb/>
      quite close to me &amp; in the act
      <lb/>
      of putting on his shirt when he
      <lb/>
      was struck by some shrapnel.
      
      <pb n="3" facs="#rb040c" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
      
      Spent the last 24 hours digging
      <lb/>
      a communication trench out to
      <lb/>
      No 2 post &amp; being sniped at.
      <lb/>
      There was a little scrap the
      <lb/>
      other night and several of the
      <lb/>
      8th were killed &amp; wounded but
      <lb/>
      no more of mine.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My sleeping bag is of
      <lb/>
      great use and I shall hang
      <lb/>
      on to it as long as possible, but
      <lb/>
      gradually many of my other
      <lb/>
      things are disappearing. You
      <lb/>
      see when one has to carry every-
      <lb/>
      thing one discards all but what
      <lb/>
      is absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      
      If you send me another
      <lb/>
      shirt please send one with
      <lb/>
      collar attached like the last,
      <lb/>
      they are so much more sensible,
      
      <pb n="4" facs="#rb040d" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
      
      I have lost all my studs, &amp;
      <lb/>
      no chance of getting any more.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      We get plenty to eat here,
      <lb/>
      many army biscuits, billy beef,
      <lb/>
      fresh meat &amp; vegetables sometimes,
      <lb/>
      jam, cheese, tea, sugar. Plain but
      <lb/>
      wholesome &amp; <name type="person">Wilson</name> evokes
      <lb/>
      wondrous stews. We also make
      <lb/>
      porridge, by pounding up the
      <lb/>
      biscuits, cooking them &amp; eating
      <lb/>
      with sugar ; we also make
      <lb/>
      puddings, same thing as above
      <lb/>
      eaten with jam at the end of
      <lb/>
      a meal instead of at the
      <lb/>
      beginning. There is also rum &amp;
      <lb/>
      tobacco issued but not enough
      <lb/>
      of the latter. I have probably
      <lb/>
      told you all this before, but in
      <lb/>
      these stirring times it is very
      <lb/>
      difficult to remember what one
      
      <pb n="5" facs="#rb040e" xml:id="t1-body-x7-pb1"/>
      
      has put in previous letters.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      I found <name type="person">little Sparrow</name>
      <lb/>
      last night, he had just arrived
      <lb/>
      with some transport. He has
      <lb/>
      promised to supplement my
      <lb/>
      larder while we are in trucks,
      <lb/>
      not that I don't get enough,
      <lb/>
      but one or two little extras
      <lb/>
      occasionally are not to be
      <lb/>
      despised .
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      We get very little war
      <lb/>
      news here, even in our own lives
      
      <pb n="6" facs="#rb040f" xml:id="t1-body-x9-pb1"/>
      
      the most fantastic rumours
      <lb/>
      get about as to what is
      <lb/>
      happening. I suppose it is
      <lb/>
      the same in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE"><choice><abbr>N. Z.</abbr><expan>New Zealand</expan></choice></name> and you
      <lb/>
      will be hearing all kinds of
      <lb/>
      weird rumours about us, all I
      <lb/>
      can say is believe nothing unless
      <lb/>
      it is certified official
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      If you find there is any-
      <lb/>
      thing in connection with this
      <lb/>
      war that you want to do &amp;
      <lb/>
      the house is an encumbrance,
      <lb/>
      sell up the whole show, if you
      <lb/>
      can't let it - I should think
      <lb/>
      letting would be better, if possible,
      <lb/>
      because we might want to go
      <lb/>
      back to it some day.

      <name type="person">Pinkie</name> is well and has I
      
      <pb n="7" facs="#rb040g" xml:id="t1-body-x11-pb1"/>
      
      believe shot two Turks.

      The worst pest here at the
      <lb/>
      present time are owls, they are
      <lb/>
      so inquisitive &amp; crawl into
      <lb/>
      everything. There are some lovely
      <lb/>
      birds with gorgeous plumage, but
      <lb/>
      I do not know their names.
      <lb/>
      There is a poppy field close here
      <lb/>
      which is lovely, contrasted with
      <lb/>
      the blue of the sky &amp; sea &amp; the green
      <lb/>
      of the scrub.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      I don't think much of
      <lb/>
      this foot work &amp; living in
      <lb/>
      trenches, although some of the
      <lb/>
      men have no desire to get
      <lb/>
      back to their houses, but they
      <lb/>
      are not many.
      
    </p>
    <p>
      
      What a contrast this is with
      
      <pb n="8" facs="#rb040e" xml:id="t1-body-x14-pb1"/>
      
      <name ref="#SAF" type="place" key="SAF">S. Africa</name>, everything different, &amp;
      <lb/>
      so much more vicious - There
      <lb/>
      we did get some relaxation
      <lb/>
      occasionally, here there is none.

      Breakfast is ready &amp; I
      <lb/>
      must eat &amp; then have a swim,
      <lb/>
      as I do not think I have
      <lb/>
      anything to do before night.
      <lb/>
      Give <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name> my love &amp; some
      <lb/>
      kisses , keep yoursleves both bright
      <lb/>
      &amp; happy &amp; don't worry about
      <lb/>
      anything , it will all come
      <lb/>
      alright &amp; perhaps the whole
      <lb/>
      show will be over in a week
      <lb/>
      or so. Kiss me my sweetheart,
      <lb/>
      I do want you so much you
      <lb/>
      are all I have.
