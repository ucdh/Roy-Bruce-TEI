			<dateline>

			<salute>Dear old thing:</salute>
		</opener>		
		<p>Your letters seem to be missing
			<lb/>
			somehow lately, and are arriving at any old
			<lb/>
			time.  I am sure there are some missing
			<lb/>
			because you don't, in your last, tell me at
			<lb/>
			all what arrangements you have made for 
			<lb/>
			<name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>'s schooling, merely mention the fact
			<lb/>
			that she has gone or is going, as if I knew 
			<lb/>
			all about it.</p>
		
		<p>I have not had any news
			<lb/>
			from you for 3 weeks, others have been
			<lb/>
			getting letters, but I suppose mine will
			<lb/>
			arrive all in a heap as they do sometimes.
		</p>
		
		<p>I am very glad to hear the 
			<lb/>
			<choice><sic>Finch's</sic><corr>Finchs</corr></choice> are doing or have done their duty
			<lb/>
			to the state, and that all goes well again
			<lb/>
			with them.  Please give them my love
			<lb/>
			and congratulations.  I wonder if 
			<name type="person">M<hi rend="u"><hi rend="sup">rs</hi></hi>
				<lb/>
				Finch
			</name>
			ever received my letter and if she
			<lb/>
			did, whether she showed it to you.  From 
			<lb/>
			what I can remember it was not written
			<lb/>
			in a very pious strain.</p>
		
		<p>Remember me to old 
			<name type="person">Harvey</name> when
			
			<pb n="2" facs="#rb065b" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb1"/>
			
			you see him, I don't forget the old bird.</p>
		
		<p>Sorry you had such a fright over
			<lb/>
			losing the ring, but glad you found it
			<lb/>
			again.  Have you had the scarab adjusted
			<lb/>
			to your finger or does it fit, you never told
			<lb/>
			me?</p>
		
		<p>Those two 
			<name type="person">Harpers</name> are good fellows, they
			<lb/>
			have both done awfully <del rend="strike">fi</del><add place="above">w</add>ell, both got their
			<lb/>
			commissions and both the D.C.M. <name type="person" ref="#GHA" key="GHA">Gordon</name>
			<lb/>
			has the machine gun here with the 
			<lb/>
			regiment and <name type="person" ref="#RPH" key="RPH">Robin</name> is running the Brigade
			<lb/>
			guns.  The old people will be very proud
			<lb/>
			of them, and with good reason.</p>
		
		<p>You ask me to tell you about the 
			<lb/>
			evacuation of <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name>, I think I have
			<lb/>
			said something in some of my letters, 
			<lb/>
			but probably not enough.  There is really
			<lb/>
			very little to tell, it is difficult to 
			<lb/>
			write about it, but sometime I will
			<lb/>
			tell you all about it, because so long
			<lb/>
			as I live, the last night at <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name> I 
			<lb/>
			shall never forget.  It was brilliant
			<lb/>
			moonlight, our side was in shadow, we
			<lb/>
			lit odd fires as usual, candles were left
			<lb/>
			burning in the dugouts, trick rifles were
			<lb/>
			placed in the trenches to go off up to
			
			<pb n="3" facs="#rb065c" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
			
			half an hour after we left, and we 
			<lb/>
			just shouldered our packs and walked
			<lb/>
			out. Our orders were that we were not
			<lb/>
			to fire a shot under any circumstances
			<lb/>
			until we got inside the original <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name>
			<lb/>
			position (we had 1/2 miles to go) and then 
			<lb/>
			if necessary we were to fight like hell &amp;
			<lb/>
			let as many get away as possible.  The 
			<lb/>
			hospitals in <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> prepared for 10,000
			<lb/>
			casualties.  We walked down to the original
			<lb/>
			position with unloaded rifles.  I was
			<lb/>
			detailed to walk in the rear of the lot.
			<lb/>
			I got them all along with a little trouble.
			<lb/>
			Probably your imagination will add
			<lb/>
			details to the whole show. I can't write 
			<lb/>
			them.</p>
		
		<p>I go the two parcels you mention
			<lb/>
			quite safely last week, thanks very much
			<lb/>
			dear.  I think I have told you the things
			<lb/>
			we like most.  We are living here very
			<lb/>
			comfortably at present, very much as at 
			<lb/>
			<name type="place" ref="#ZEI" key="ZEI"><choice><sic>Zietoun</sic><corr>Zeitoun</corr></choice></name>, but of course we do not know 
			<lb/>
			how long it will last, or where we are
			<lb/>
			going to.  The general opinion points to
			<lb/>
			<name type="place" ref="#FRA" key="FRA">France</name>, but honestly we are as likely
			<lb/>
			to go there as anywhere else.</p>
		
		<pb n="4" facs="#rb065d" xml:id="t1-body-pb2"/>
		
		<p>If you are going in for this hospital
			<lb/>
			training, you must realise there is no
			<lb/>
			individual sentiment about it.  If you
			<lb/>
			go, you give up everything, and do just as
			<lb/>
			you are told.  You cannot make your
			<lb/>
			own conditions.  I should very much
			<lb/>
			like to see you do it, but at the same
			<lb/>
			time you are not to feel you are com-
			<lb/>
			pelled to, and if you cannot give up <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>,
			<lb/>
			why cut it out.  This war will not be
			<lb/>
			over for some time, and if you leave
			<lb/>
			<name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE"><choice><abbr>N.Z.</abbr><expan>New Zealand</expan></choice></name> you must make up your mind 
			<lb/>
			for possibly a prolonged absence.  So far
			<lb/>
			as your health is concerned, don't let
			<lb/>
			that worry you, it would probably 
			<lb/>
			affect you as it has me. I am fitter
			<lb/>
			now that I have been for years, and
			<lb/>
			I don't altogether spare myself at times.
			<lb/>
			If you get ill, why you get well looked
			<lb/>
			after, and noone, except at odd times
			<lb/>
			is asked to do impossibilities.  The training
			<lb/>
			&amp; the discipline will proved very irksome
			<lb/>
			to you, but if you start on the lines that 
			<lb/>
			an order is an order, and there can be
			<lb/>
			no criticism, why then you will be alright.
			<lb/>
			I think it would do you an awful lot
			
			<pb n="5" facs="#rb065e" xml:id="t1-body-x10-pb1"/>
			
			of good, but weigh carefully all you will
			<lb/>
			have to give up temporarily.  Don't worry
			<lb/>
			about me, whatever can happen to
			<lb/>
			me at any time I shall always get
			<lb/>
			the very best attention.  <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name> must be
			<lb/>
			your only consideration.</p>
		
		<p>I am very glad <name type="person">Miss Trask</name> has got
			<lb/>
			away, I don't know where she is but
			<lb/>
			I have sent her a line tonight. She
			<lb/>
			may be quite close or she may be a long
			<lb/>
			way away.</p>
		
		<p>I got 48 hours leave last week &amp; went
			<lb/>
			to <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> - some spree - details verbally
			<lb/>
			some day, about these things, as usual.</p>
		
		<p><name type="person" ref="#CHI" key="CHI">Chillie</name> is back at <name type="place" ref="#ZEI" key="ZEI"><choice><sic>Zietoun</sic><corr>Zeitoun</corr></choice></name> now I 
			<lb/>
			believe, after touring <name type="place" ref="#ITL" key="ITL">Italy</name>. Some people 
			<lb/>
			manage to fall on their feet from any
			<lb/>
			altitude.</p>
		
		<p>Well good night old girl.  I must go
			<lb/>
			to bed. You told me nothing about
			<lb/>
			<name type="person">Harvey</name>'s visit, except that he had been
			<lb/>
			to see you.  Kiss <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name> for me, and remember
			<lb/>
			me to anyone who asks.  Saw old <name type="person" ref="#AND" key="AND">Andrews</name>
			<lb/>
			yesterday at <name type="place" ref="#ISM" key="ISM">Ismailia</name>, he is very well.</p>
