      <salute>My dearest girl:</salute>
    </opener>    
    <p>      
      Have had quite a good time
      <lb/>
      lately, receiving letters &amp; parcels from you,
      <lb/>
      several letters of various dates &amp; 3 parcels.
      <lb/>
      1 containing socks &amp; cigarettes, 2 shirts, singlets
      <lb/>
      etc, 3 books, cigarettes, socks, chocolate, tooth-
      <lb/>
      paste, shaving soap, soap &amp; towel, all of 
      <lb/>
      which especially the latter one were very
      <lb/>
      welcome indeed and I do thank you for
      <lb/>
      them.
    </p>    
    <p>      
      Have just received orders to hold
      <lb/>
      myself in readiness to leave here at any
      <lb/>
      moment for <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name> with an advance party
      <lb/>
      so the next letter you will get from me
      <lb/>
      will be from the old familiar trenches.
    </p>    
    <p>      
      Your letters today speak of
      <lb/>
      <name type="person" ref="#CYH" key="CYH">Pinkie</name>, don't worry too much dear, there
      <lb/>
      is still hope that he is a prisoner,
      <lb/>
      although I am afraid it is a very small
      <lb/>
      one. He was in charge of the old squadron
      <lb/>
      that night, he was the only officer left, &amp;
      <lb/>
      the squadron only consisted of about 30 men,
      <lb/>
      all that was left of 160. The men that
      <lb/>
      came back said he was splendid &amp; that
      
      <pb n="2" facs="#rb055b" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
      
      is a great tribute. He did well and
      <lb/>
      that is really all that matters these days.
    </p>
      
      <p>
        
        Regarding our little frey, that only
        <lb/>
        lasted 3 days and we were always the
        <lb/>
        very best of friends, why, we shared the
        <lb/>
        same tent all the time we were in
        <lb/>
        <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name> and dug outs &amp; things on the
        <lb/>
        Peninsula. I always had more regard
        <lb/>
        for him than any other member of your
        <lb/>
        family. So cheer up old girl. There
        <lb/>
        are no such things as personal quarrels
        <lb/>
        out here, one week at <name type="place" ref="#ANZ" key="ANZ">Anzac</name> &amp; the whole
        <lb/>
        world is kin.
      </p>
      
      <p>        
        Some things are really amusing
        <lb/>
        out here, especially the new brigade, who
        <lb/>
        really though they were soldiers. The other 
        <lb/>
        day the Brigadier (this is confidential) sent
        <lb/>
        for all officers and "strafed" every body. He
        <lb/>
        said "There is not a squadron or troop
        <lb/>
        leader amongst you who has the foggiest
        <lb/>
        notion of what to do with his men. I
        <lb/>
        am not referring to the old ones, I know
        <lb/>
        what they can do. I have seen them at
        <lb/>
        it. That's all gentlemen" I can assure
        <lb/>
        you I was most thankful that I was
        <lb/>
        not a reinforcement. That night the
        
        <pb n="3" facs="#rb055c" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
        
        band played "The boys of the old brigade"
        <lb/>
        round the camp and the  Brigadier
        <lb/>
        refused to be comforted.
      </p>
      
      <p>        
        <name type="person" ref="#AND" key="AND">Andrews</name> left here yesterday with his
        <lb/>
        advance party. I am sure to see him
        <lb/>
        over there. We have had some good times
        <lb/>
        together.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
        I was on a destroyer La Forey the
        <lb/>
        other day and had rather an amusing
        <lb/>
        time. The commander was telling us a
        <lb/>
        story (quite true) of a submarine in the
        <lb/>
        north Sea who fired her only two topedo
        <lb/>
        tubes at a German vessel and missed &amp;
        <lb/>
        had to seek refuge at the bottom of the
        <lb/>
        sea. The skipper chanced to go forward &amp;
        <lb/>
        found a sailer with a bucket of water
        <lb/>
        in which he was "strafing" something,
        <lb/>
        saying "I'll teach you to miss, you
        <lb/>
        little etc, I'll swear you won't do it again
        <lb/>
        you blighter etc etc, the skipper thought
        <lb/>
        he had lost his nerve or something, but
        <lb/>
        nothing of the kind. "I'm drowning the
        <lb/>
        ship's mascot, sir, I'll teach him to miss".
        <lb/>
        The mascot was a golliwog!!
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
        Had another letter from <name type="person">Mrs Druce</name>
        <lb/>
        the other day, there was nothing in it
        
        <pb n="4" facs="#rb055d" xml:id="t1-body-x9-pb1"/>
        
        of importance. She is well and
        <lb/>
        most anxious to send things, but we
        <lb/>
        are so well equipped there is really
        <lb/>
        nothing we want.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
        <name type="person" ref="#CHI" key="CHI">Chillie</name> is very well and flourishing,
        <lb/>
        he has altered a lot and is more forbearing
        <lb/>
        with everyone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
        We are wearing infantry equipment
        <lb/>
        now and are trussed up like Donkey's
        <lb/>
        at a feast. It is more comfortable than
        <lb/>
        our old equipment, but of course we walk
        <lb/>
        now of unfortunately.
      </p>
      
      <p>        
        I have one regret here now, that
        <lb/>
        <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE"><choice><abbr>N. Z.</abbr><expan>New Zealand</expan></choice></name> did not see our brigade &amp; the
        <lb/>
        infantry before it left <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>. They were
        <lb/>
        soldiers these are senitorials.
      </p>

        <name type="person">Webb</name> says the war will be over in
        <lb/>
        November, but he did not say which
        <lb/>
        November, anyway it may finish sooner
        <lb/>
        than we think. God bless you both
