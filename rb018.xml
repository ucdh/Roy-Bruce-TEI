                    <lb/>
                    we shall be at <name type="place" ref="#ADN">Aden</name> and mark off

                    another stage on our journey.

                <p>Nothing of importance
                    <lb/>
                    has happened since we left <name type="place" ref="#COL">Colombo</name>,
                    <lb/>
                    except that it has been very hot
                    <lb/>
                    all the way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We spent two days
                    <lb/>
                    at <name type="place" ref="#COL">Colombo</name>, and we were able
                    <lb/>
                    to go on shore with the men &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    march them about the town in
                    <lb/>
                    parties of 30. I took one lot on
                    <lb/>
                    shore and we had a great time.
                    <lb/>
                    We went right through the native
                    <lb/>
                    quarter and I have not enjoyed
                    <lb/>
                    a walk so much for a long time.
                    <lb/>
                    It was frightfully hot &amp; we quickly
                    <lb/>
                    sweltered in khaki, but didn't
                    <lb/>
                    mind it a bit.

                    quarter are narrow but not very
                    <lb/>
                    dirty, although I would not like
                    <lb/>
                    to say as much about the houses.
                </p>
                <p>Imagine for yourself a narrow
                    <lb/>
                    winding street with houses on either
                    <lb/>
                    side of various colours made of a
                    <lb/>
                    sort of stucco, bars for windows,
                    <lb/>
                    little open shops underneath,
                    <lb/>
                    mostly very dirty, and every
                    <lb/>
                    now &amp; then a Buddhist temple
                    <lb/>
                    in (from the outside!) a more or
                    <lb/>
                    less dilapidated condition. The
                    <lb/>
                    street crowded with men &amp; children,
                    <lb/>
                    and an occasional woman. The
                    <lb/>
                    men wearing robes &amp; white European
                    <lb/>
                    clothes often very dirty, and the
                    <lb/>
                    children almost naked. Riksha
                    <lb/>
                    men running up &amp; down, a quaint
                    <lb/>
                    wagon drawn by very small
                    <lb/>
                    oxen passing up &amp; down. Some
                    <lb/>
                    of the children are very pretty
                    <lb/>
                    &amp; have the most lovely eyes. The
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="place" ref="#CEY">Ceylon</name> native the Tamil, is rather
                    <lb/>
                    undersized but the Cingalese although
                    
                    <pb n="3" facs="#rb018c" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x6-pb1"/>
                    
                    a little bigger are not much.
                    <lb/>
                    Some of the men are handsome
                    <lb/>
                    but the majority not so. I only
                    <lb/>
                    saw a few women and only one
                    <lb/>
                    good looking one. We went on
                    <lb/>
                    and found a fruit bazaar &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    the noise was terrific. Everyone
                    <lb/>
                    wanted to sell something cheaper
                    <lb/>
                    than the last. I let the men
                    <lb/>
                    buy some fruit. We eventually
                    <lb/>
                    came to the modern part of the
                    <lb/>
                    city and there <choice><sic>there</sic><corr></corr></choice> are some
                    <lb/>
                    very handsome buildings &amp; shops.
                    <lb/>
                    I very much wanted to get some
                    <lb/>
                    little thing &amp; send it you but
                    <lb/>
                    I did not have an opportunity.
                    <lb/>
                    I saw the place where <name type="person" ref="#HUR">Hurdley</name>
                    <lb/>
                    gets a lot of his stuff from &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    all I found out were large
                    <lb/>
                    black elephants standing 1 foot
                    <lb/>
                    high 2/6. I think I gave him
                    <lb/>
                    2/6 for that nice one on the
                    <lb/>
                    mantelpiece! I should much 
                    <lb/>
                    have liked a few hours to myself
                    
                    <pb n="4" facs="#rb018d" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x6-pb2"/>
                    
                    to fossick round but it was not
                    <lb/>
                    to be.
                </p>
                <p>The following day I was
                    <lb/>
                    trying to arrange to go on shore
                    <lb/>
                    to buy a few things for myself
                    <lb/>
                    &amp; others, when I was suddenly
                    <lb/>
                    ordered to take 3 boats 27 men
                    <lb/>
                    (we were anchored in the stream
                    <lb/>
                    1 1/2 miles from the shore) &amp; go &amp; get
                    <lb/>
                    some provisions, so that upset
                    <lb/>
                    my little plan. I was given
                    <lb/>
                    infantry crews who had had 
                    <lb/>
                    no dinner, we left at 12.30,
                    <lb/>
                    reached the shore a little after.
                    <lb/>
                    1 waited till 3 for the provisions,
                    <lb/>
                    loaded up, got away at 3.20
                    <lb/>
                    (still nothing to eat) &amp; started
                    <lb/>
                    for the ship, incidentally carrying
                    <lb/>
                    provisions also for the Waimana
                    <lb/>
                    who had forgotten to send a 
                    <lb/>
                    boat of <del rend="strike">the</del> her own. Well we
                    <lb/>
                    got along to within about 600
                    <lb/>
                    yards of our own ship when she
                    <lb/>
                    pulled up her anchor &amp; went
                    
                    <pb n="5" facs="#rb018e" xml:id="t1-body-d1-x7-pb1"/>
                    
                    to the outer anchorage over a
                    <lb/>
                    mile further on. We had a
                    <lb/>
                    head wind, a strong current &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    a cross sea, it was also beginning
                    <lb/>
                    to get dark. We reached this
                    <lb/>
                    ship at 7 o'clock, just about
                    <lb/>
                    dead. We were quite happy &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    those infantry fellows behaved
                    <lb/>
                    splendidly, they had had
                    <lb/>
                    nothing to eat since 7 in
                    <lb/>
                    the morning. Since that trip
                    <lb/>
                    I am sure if those men were
                    <lb/>
                    properly handled they would
                    <lb/>
                    be as good as any others.
                </p>
                <p>This morning Tuesday there is
                    <lb/>
                    almost a complete calm, the only ripples
                    <lb/>
                    on the sea caused by the movement of
                    <lb/>
                    the ships. We are not far from land,
                    <lb/>
                    some swallows were flying round the
                    <lb/>
                    ship this morning. Jelly fish, sharks &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    <choice><sic>bonito's</sic><corr>bonitos</corr></choice> are quite common in this sea.
                </p>
                <p>My writing is rather weird because
                    <lb/>
                    I am having lessons in sword fighting
                    <lb/>

                </p>
                <p>
                    I wonder if you will get any of
                    <lb/>
                    my letters before Christmas. I rather
                    <lb/>
                    doubt it. Perhaps the censored ones
                    <lb/>
                    will reach you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps I may be able to send you
                    <lb/>
                    something from <name type="place" ref="#ADN">Aden</name>, but it is
                    <lb/>
                    all in the air at present.
                </p>
                <p>I suppose you will spend Xmas
                    <lb/>
                    in the country? I hope you both will
                    <lb/>
                    enjoy yourselves. We had quite a nice
                    <lb/>
                    one together last year didn't we dear?
                </p>
                <p>If <name type="person" ref="#HEB">Helen</name> has some spare toys she
                    <lb/>
                    perhaps might like to send them Home
                    <lb/>
                    for some refugees, I have no doubt
                    <lb/>
                    they would be glad of them, &amp; you
                    <lb/>
                    could find out the right address.
                </p>
                <p>I don't expect to get any letters from
                    <lb/>
                    you till we get to <name type="place" ref="#ENG">England</name>, which

                    should be just about Xmas day.
                </p>
                <p>I wish I could let myself go in

                    these letters, there is so much to tell
                    <lb/>
                    you about men &amp; things on board,

                    but I don't exactly know whether these
                    <lb/>
                    letters will be censored or only delayed.
                    <lb/>
                    It would be grand to have a yarn
                    <lb/>
                    with you.

                    <lb/>
                    of this voyage &amp; the monotony of it,
                    <lb/>
                    I am really enjoying myself, &amp; I

                    before. I felt completely at home in

                    the place, and although I was not

                <p>Blackmoor is well. A swelling

                    well, and although he is thinner

                    enjoying himself. He is making

                    an excellent soldier and is one of

                    is that he will be promoted too
