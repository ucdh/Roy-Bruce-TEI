                <p>
                    Here we are in <name type="place" ref="#EGY">Egypt</name> and
                    <lb/>
                    settled here for a few months anyway. It was all
                    <lb/>
                    very sudden.  We did not know definitely that we
                    <lb/>
                    were getting off until we reached <name type="place" ref="#SUZ">Suez</name>, although we
                    <lb/>
                    had been told to prepare for a possible disembarkation
                    <lb/>
                    two days before.  We went on from <name type="place" ref="#SUZ">Suez</name> to <name type="place" ref="#PRS">Port Said</name> 
                    <lb/>
                    &amp; thence to <name type="place" ref="#ALX">Alexandria</name> where we disembarked &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    entrained for <name type="place" ref="#PZU">Palais Zubba</name> which is a mile from
                    <lb/>
                    here &amp; altogether 7 miles from <name type="place" ref="#CAR">Cairo</name> on the right
                    <lb/>
                    hand side of <name type="place" ref="#NIL">the Nile</name> facing down stream.</p>
                <p>
                    We disembarked here, (the Australians as well as
                    <lb/>
                    us) because there is a possibility of trouble with 
                    <lb/>
                    the Turks Arabs. You will have seen in the
                    <lb/>
                    newspapers that the Khedive has got the sack, &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    there is a rumour to the effect that we are going
                    <lb/>
                    to annex the country but I do not think that
                    <lb/>
                    will be done if the people agree to the new Khedive
                    <lb/>
                    we propose to put up. If there is any serious
                    <lb/>
                    trouble of course then we shall take over the

                    whole show. The danger at present is of a 
                    <lb/>
                    Turkish advance across the <name type="place" ref="#SIP">Sinai peninsula</name> on
                    <lb/>
                    the canal. They have a railway which runs
                    <lb/>
                    from the <name type="place" ref="#DAN">Dardanelles</name> right down through <name type="place" ref="#DAM">Damascus</name>
                    <lb/>
                    to within 70 miles of the <unclear>lines</unclear> Egyptian frontier.
                    <lb/>
                    Their main difficulty will be the question of
                    <lb/>
                    transport across about 200 miles of desert, but that
                    <lb/>
                    should not deter them if they have any enterprising
                    <lb/>
                    leaders. The <name type="place" ref="#SUC">Suez canal</name> is at once the most
                    <lb/>
                    valuable &amp; one of the most vital spots of the Empire
                    <lb/>
                    today and is worth sacrifices to attack.  The
                    <lb/>
                    canal is well guarded principally by Gurkhas &amp; 
                    <lb/>
                    Palhaus &amp; a camel corps. We saw them all as
                    <lb/>
                    we passed through it was a grand sight.  They
                    <lb/>
                    have already had a few skirmishes with some 
                    <lb/>
                    Arabs but nothing very serious as yet. 
                </p>
                
                <p>There is no doubt that most of the people
                    <lb/>
                    i.e. Egyptians &amp; Arabs dislike us very much &amp; if they
                    <lb/>
                    thought they had any show they would rise at
                    <lb/>
                    once.  We are concentrating about 100,000 troops here
                    <lb/>
                    in the hope that the display of force will prevent 
                    <lb/>
                    any trouble, but I am convinced that when 
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="place" ref="#TUR">Turkey</name> moves that will be the signal for a rising,
                    <lb/>
                    and I have gone so far as to make a small

                    bet (gambling again) that we shall have some
                    <lb/>
                    fighting here, before we leave for <name type="place" ref="#EUR">Europe</name> in the 
                    <lb/>
                    spring. </p>
                <p>
                    Our camp is situated on the site of the 
                    <lb/>
                    ancient city of <name type="place" ref="#HEL">Heliopolis</name> on the edge of the desert.
                    <lb/>
                    In fact we are camped on the desert in the sand.
                    <lb/>
                    The new city of <name type="place" ref="#HEL">Heliopolis</name> which is a fashionable 
                    <lb/>
                    suburb of <name type="place" ref="#CAR">Cairo</name> and has only just been built &amp; 
                    <lb/>
                    is run by a Belgian company is just beside us &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    really I cannot describe it. The houses, shops &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    hotels are simply magnificent. The architecture 
                    <lb/>
                    defies description. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do so wish I could do some descriptive 
                    <lb/>
                    writing and explain to you all I have seen &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    my impressions of it, but it is beyond me. If 
                    <lb/>
                    only you were here you would be able to write
                    <lb/>
                    volumes and you would enjoy yourself.

                    had our dinner in an Egyptian cafe surrounded

                    <lb/>
                    the Bazaars. Different parts are given over to different
                    <lb/>
                    nationalities: thus one finds Italians in one part,
                    <lb/>
                    Turks in another, Soudanese, Egyptians, Arabs etc in

                    other parts.  There it is one sees them in all their

                    a typical Parisian boulevard. In the brilliant well
                    <lb/>
                    dressed throng one hears all languages again.
                    <lb/>
                    East meets west, but they don't mix. They do not

                    then up to now there has been no time to write

                    any more. We have been tramping the desert

                    tiring walking in the sand &amp; stones until one

                    Yesterday afternoon I had free &amp; 4 of us went
                    <lb/>
                    into <name type="place" ref="#CAR">Cairo</name> &amp; spent the evening there. </p>
                <p> 
                    I sent you a cable announcing I was well, 
                    <lb/>
                    I shortened the address but I think you will get
                    <lb/>
                    it alright. I also sent you yesterday a dress
                    <lb/>
                    length in blue and one in pink for <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>. I hope
                    <lb/>
                    they will reach you safely. I am sorry I could
                    <lb/>
                    not pay the duty this end but it will not 
                    
                    <pb n="6" facs="#rb020f" xml:id="t1-body-d2-x4-pb1"/>
                    
                    amount to very much. I hope you will
                    <lb/>
                    like the stuff, it is an Egyptian fabric &amp;wears
                    <lb/>
                    &amp; washes very well. I got it at an Oriental 
                    <lb/>
                    shop containing a most gorgeous collection of
                    <lb/>
                    things. The sort of shop one could spend hours
                    <lb/>
                    in and many pounds. I thought the dress
                    <lb/>
                    was probably the most useful thing to send you,
                    <lb/>
                    although I nearly sent you a big shawl that
                    <lb/>
                    would go through a ring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the easiest place to spend money
                    <lb/>
                    in I ever saw, there is so much to see &amp; do,
                    <lb/>
                    &amp; some things are very dear.

                    Last night when we had done our
                    <lb/>
                    shopping etc, had afternoon tea at <name type="place">Shepheards</name>
                    <lb/>
                    etc we had dinner at the Jump Club, a
                    <lb/>
                    rather exclusive place (our party consisted of
                    <lb/>
                    <name type="person" ref="#HAW">Hawkins</name> late 11th Hussars &amp; now Brigade staff, who
                    <lb/>
                    took us there, <name type="person" ref="#MYN">Mayne</name>, <name type="person" ref="#BLT">Blackett</name> of <name type="organisation" ref="#NRT">Nelson reg<hi rend="sup">t</hi></name> &amp;
                    <lb/>
                    myself). After dinner (one dines at eight here) 
                    <lb/>
                    we sallied forth in search of adventures, we 
                    <lb/>
                    hired a guide from <name type="place">Shepheards</name> &amp; it is quite
                    <lb/>
                    impossible for me to tell you the places he took
                    <lb/>
                    us to and what we saw there. It was
                    <lb/>
                    certainly experience, but I never wish to see

                    so much vice again. It was revolting. Someday
                    <lb/>
                    I may give you a few horrible details.

                    Next moon the four of us are going to 
                    <lb/>
                    arrange a little excursion to see the minx by
                    <lb/>
                    spotlight, I mean the Spinhx by moonlight. I

                    will try &amp; record my impressions afterwards.

                    <lb/>
                    gorgeous. When we meet I do not expect to stop
                    <lb/>
                    talking for months. The weather is lovely, warm
                    <lb/>
                    days all sunlight &amp; cold nights all starlight. I 
                    <lb/>
                    am already getting horribly fat. There is much
                    <lb/>
                    more French spoken here than English &amp; I find
                    <lb/>
                    mine very useful.

                    does not do it soon I am going to. I want to 
                    <lb/>
                    find out about the Egyptian army. I hear that
                    <lb/>
                    he is a big bug here &amp; he will probably be able
                    <lb/>
                    to give me all sorts of information.

                    The native villages here are weird places,

                    built of mud and bolstered up with bits of wood, 
                    <lb/>
                    filthy dirty, smelling abominably. Their cemeteries are
                    <lb/>
                    just outside the walls. Mostly square mud heaps, but
                    <lb/>
                    some are plastered &amp; they look just like large cream
