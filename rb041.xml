                &amp; your visit to the crystal gazer.

                I wish these blighters would be a

                to cause me a sleepless night, lying

                in a dug out under the stars and
                <lb/>
                bullets, during which I very carefully
                <lb/>
                went over all I could remember of
                <lb/>
                my childhood's days, and I must
                <lb/>
                admit that by 3 a.m when we stood
                <lb/>
                to arms, I had the stage set for a
                <lb/>

                also set a price for fair play.
                <lb/>
                However the only chance I have
                <lb/>
                of finding out anything is to get to
                <lb/>
                <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name> and investigate for my-

                self. There may be no chance of
                <lb/>
                that, as if the war finishes early
                <lb/>
                we may go directly back to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z</name>
                <lb/>
                from here, and I certainly can't 
                <lb/>
                afford a trip to <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name> on my

                own. I do not think much
                <lb/>
                good will be done by writing to
                <lb/>
                solicitors. You see the thing is
                <lb/>
                so complicated that I prefer to 
                <lb/>
                trust no one that I cannot see
                <lb/>
                for myself, and as you say, and I 
                <lb/>
                quite agree, everything must be done
                <lb/>
                very quietly. You see I may be
                <lb/>
                wronging innocent people &amp; if there
                <lb/>
                is nothing in it; after all; these
                <lb/>
                people brought me up. Your letter
                <lb/>
                has certainly made me think more
                <lb/>
                about myself than I have thought
                <lb/>
                all my life, and it is quite possible

                that I may have been too credulous.
                <lb/>
                I promise you that if I can once
                <lb/>
                get to <name type="place" ref="#ENG" key="ENG">England</name> I will investigate
                <lb/>
                everything very fully, and will satisfy
                <lb/>
                myself that all is in order.
                <lb/>
                I am not quite clear as to your 
                <lb/>
                meaning about <choice><sic>their</sic><corr>there</corr></choice> being something

                <lb/>
                can explain that some other time.
                <lb/>
                I would not count too much on

                possibility of there being something
                <lb/>
                wrong somewhere, I don't think it
