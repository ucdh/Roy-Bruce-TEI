    <p>
      I arrived back
      <lb/>
      here yesterday morning about
      <lb/>
      4 o'clock and found the
      <lb/>
      regiment in fresh dugouts having 
      <lb/>
      a few days spell.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Tomorrow we go
      <lb/>
      into a new line of trenches for
      <lb/>
      a fortnight, quite close to the 
      <lb/>
      Turkish lines and we shall
      <lb/>
      probably get some experience
      <lb/>
      of hand grenades. The Turks
      <lb/>
      have a goodly supply and so 
      <lb/>
      have we.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I was very glad to 
      
      <pb n="2" facs="#rb045b" xml:id="t1-body-x4-pb1"/>
      
      get away from that hospital -
      <lb/>
      it was not very well managed,
      <lb/>
      and I wasn't getting fit
      <lb/>
      quick enough so I thought
      <lb/>
      I would come back, and I
      <lb/>
      feel ever so much better since
      <lb/>
      I arrived here.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There have been no further
      <lb/>
      casualties amongst my lot,
      <lb/>
      everything on our line very
      <lb/>
      quiet. <name type="person">Major Wain</name> &amp; <name type="person">Gibbs</name>
      <lb/>
      the signalling officer were hit
      <lb/>
      by a stray shell yesterday
      <lb/>
      morning. I don't think
      <lb/>
      either are seriously wounded,
      <lb/>
      (<name type="person">Major Wain's</name> was through the
      <lb/>
      leg) but of course they will
      <lb/>
      be away for some time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I found a letter &amp; two
      
      <pb n="3" facs="#rb045c" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
      
      papers from you waiting for
      <lb/>
      me which wer very welcome,
      <lb/>
      &amp; I got another letter today.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I hope your little scheme
      <lb/>
      with <name type="person">Greene</name> materialises, it
      <lb/>
      sounds promising.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You seem to be playing a
      <lb/>
      great game of golf.  Haven't you
      <lb/>
      brought your handicap down
      <lb/>
      yet?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I don't know what is happen-
      <lb/>
      ing to the parcels, I have 
      <lb/>
      received two from you which
      <lb/>
      I acknowledged from <name type="place" ref="#EGY" key="EGY">Egypt</name>.
      <lb/>
      Everyone is the same &amp; it is 
      <lb/>
      nothing to do with the O.C.
      <lb/>
      There will be a day of reckon-
      <lb/>
      ing for some of these people
      <lb/>
      later on.  Thanks for the 
      
      <pb n="4" facs="#rb045d" xml:id="t1-body-x9-pb1"/>
      
      handkerchief contained in the 
      <lb/>
      letter, the main things we
      <lb/>
      want while we are in the 
      <lb/>
      field are little luxuries to eat.
      <lb/>
      It is very hard to get any-
      <lb/>
      think here.  Chocolate, cocoa,
      <lb/>
      coffee, cake, anything like that
      <lb/>
      is very acceptable.  I don't
      <lb/>
      want you to spend your money
      <lb/>
      on me, and <del rend="strike">ver</del> small parcels
      <lb/>
      are best, so if you sometimes
      <lb/>
      could manage to send me
      <lb/>
      some little things I should
      <lb/>
      be very grateful.  Anyway I
      <lb/>
      don't anticipate being here
      <lb/>
      many months, I think the
      <lb/>
      show will finish up before
      <lb/>
      the winter here, but anyway
      <lb/>
      we may still be in the
      
      <pb n="5" facs="#rb045e" xml:id="t1-body-x9-pb2"/>
      
      field somewhere.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I am awfully glad you
      <lb/>
      are interesting yourself in
      <lb/>
      making things for the Red Cross
      <lb/>
      etc, it is good work and any
      <lb/>
      amount is needed.  You will
      <lb/>
      find some difficulty in having
      <lb/>
      the stuff sent for our wounded
      <lb/>
      &amp; sick, because 
      <choice>
        <sic>the</sic>
        <corr>they</corr>
      </choice>
      go all over
      <lb/>
      the place, <name type="place">Malta</name>, <name type="place">Egypt</name>, <name type="place" ref="#BRI" key="BRI">England</name>
      <lb/>
      &amp; some back to <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">N.Z</name>.  It does
      <lb/>
      not matter where it goes to
      <lb/>
      so long as someone gets it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Keep yourself as much
      <lb/>
      occupied as possible and then
      <lb/>
      you won't think too much.
      <lb/>
      You must not worry about 
      <lb/>
      me, because I shall be
      <lb/>
      alright, and let me impress
      
      <pb n="6" facs="#rb045f" xml:id="t1-body-x11-pb1"/>
      
      upon you again not to 
      <lb/>
      believe anything you hear.
      <lb/>
      I read in the "Times" list of
      <lb/>
      N.Z. Casualties that <name type="person">Capt Houlker</name>
      <lb/>
      had died of wounds - <name type="person">Houlker</name>
      <lb/>
      is here perfectly and was
      <lb/>
      only away a few days with
      <lb/>
      a slight flesh wound.  So you
      <lb/>
      see the papers don't know
      <lb/>
      much.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Your criticism about the
      <lb/>
      landing party not taking
      <lb/>
      cover is not quite right. You
      <lb/>
      see the place had to be
      <lb/>
      stormed and one can't take
      <lb/>
      cover storming hills with
      <lb/>
      entrenched Turks on to.
      <lb/>
      Their only fault was they went
      <lb/>
      too far and troops could not
      
      <pb n="7" facs="#rb045g" xml:id="t1-body-x12-pb1"/>
      
      be landed fast enough to
      <lb/>
      support them. They did very
      <lb/>
      well and some praise won't
      <lb/>
      hurt them.

      Have you heard this one:-
      <lb/>
      Two men travelled round the
      <lb/>
      country with a performing
      <lb/>
      bear. When they stayed at
      <lb/>
      hotels the bear always slept
      <lb/>
      outside the door of their 
      <lb/>
      room. One night they heard
      <lb/>
      a noise outside and a female
      <lb/>
      voice down the passage.
      <lb/>
      "Well, if you must, you must,
      <lb/>
      but at least take off that
      <lb/>
      heavy motor coat" -

      I think <name type="person" ref="#HEB" key="HEB">Helen</name>'s remark
      <lb/>
      about Satan being a German
      <lb/>
      is lovely, with a good drawing
      
      <pb n="8" facs="#rb045h" xml:id="t1-body-x14-pb1"/>
      
      it would do for Punch.
      <lb/>
      Dear little soul, I am just
      <lb/>
      longing to see you all again.
      <lb/>
      This is a very deadly form of
      <lb/>
      warfare but it cannot last
      <lb/>
      for ever.  Cheer up dearest
      <lb/>
      &amp; be happy, kiss me darling
      <lb/>
      &amp; give <name type="person">Helen</name> a big fat one.
      <lb/>
      I expect you will want
      <lb/>
      all your philosophy just now,
      <lb/>
      so just go on quietly and
      <lb/>
      peacefully &amp; believe always
      <lb/>
      in the best.  We have many
      <lb/>
      happy years in store dear
      <lb/>
      one although perhaps they do
      <lb/>
      seem a long time coming.
      <lb/>
      God bless you both my darlings.
      <lb/>
      <salute>Your loving husband</salute>
