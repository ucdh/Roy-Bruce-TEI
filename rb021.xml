            <p>
                I got two letters from you just
                <lb/>
                before Christmas. It seemed so strange to get 
                <lb/>
                your news a few days after I left, and yet
                <lb/>
                not receive it until now, it took me quite
                <lb/>
                a little time to adjust things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                I am glad things are well with
                <lb/>
                you, they certainly are with me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                Sorry you are not handicapper
                <lb/>
                any more, but perhaps it is just as well as
                <lb/>
                you will probably be away more or less, and
                <lb/>
                it was rather a tie, although you did get your
                <lb/>
                golf for nothing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                
                Went to a race meeting here the 
                <lb/>
                other day at <name type="place" ref="#GEZ" key="GEZ">Gezirah</name>, rather a pretty course &amp;
                <lb/>
                it was awfully nice to see some green things
                <lb/>
                again after the interminable sand of the 
                <lb/>
                desert. The racing was good several amateur
                <lb/>
                events as well as professional. They run
                <lb/>
                totalisators from 51 upwards, but not quite
                
                <pb n="2" facs="#rb021b" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb1"/>
                
                
                
                on the same system as ours. The horses
                <lb/>
                are lovely, all arabs, browns &amp; greys, nothing
                <lb/>
                over 14.2, but most perfectly made &amp; can
                <lb/>
                go all day. I have never seen such 
                <lb/>
                pictures before. It was this type of horse 
                <lb/>
                averaging 14.1 that carried 16 stone in the 
                <lb/>
                Lancers charge at <name type="place" ref="#OMD" key="OMD">Omdurman</name>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After the races we got into a cab &amp;
                <lb/>
                drove to the Pyramids, it was nearly dark 
                <lb/>
                when we got there so we were not able to 
                <lb/>
                see much, but in what we did see I must
                <lb/>
                confess to a slight feeling of disappointment,
                <lb/>
                certainly not in the Sphinx or Pyramids themselves
                <lb/>
                but in their surroundings. Imagine to
                <lb/>
                yourself an electric tramway within a stone's 
                <lb/>
                thro<add place="inline">w</add><del rend="strike">ough</del> , then a modern hotel with all 
                <lb/>
                Eastern European luxuries adjoining, and to 
                <lb/>
                make matters worse hundreds of howling
                <lb/>
                Australians (they are camped close by) some of
                <lb/>
                them more or less drunk and the charm &amp;
                <lb/>
                mystery of the whole place has gone. The 
                <lb/>
                Sphinx defies any description I can give of it,
                <lb/>
                but one requires solitude to weave the
                <lb/>
                romances of the ages round it, &amp; that is
                
                <pb n="3" facs="#rb021c" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
                
                impossible at the present time. However I
                <lb/>
                shall go again with I hope better result
                <lb/>
                There has not been any opportunity of making further excursions as yet, but some
                <lb/>
                of us are talking of taking camels &amp; going 
                <lb/>
                to <name type="place" ref="#MEM" key="MEM">Memphis</name> next Sunday. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I wonder how you spent Xmas day;
                <lb/>
                very quietly I expect at Rolleston. We had
                <lb/>
                a rather interesting day. <name type="person" ref="#WAI">Major Wain</name>,
                <lb/>
                <name type="person" ref="#HHH" key="HHH">Hammond</name> &amp; myself went to the citadel
                <lb/>
                in the morning. The citadel is the big fort
                <lb/>
                built high up over the town, now occupied
                <lb/>
                by troops and a hospital, beyond that 
                <lb/>
                again &amp; dominating it &amp; with a causeway
                <lb/>
                leading up to a drawbridge is the fort
                <lb/>
                <name type="person" ref="#NAP">Napoleon</name> built, now in ruins. In the 
                <lb/>
                citadel there is the palace (which is the hospital)
                <lb/>
                &amp; the mosque of <name type="person" ref="#MAL"><choice><sic>Mohamed Aly</sic><corr>Muhammad Ali</corr></choice></name> who ran the 
                <lb/>
                show at one time.  This gentleman was so
                <lb/>
                pleased with the design &amp; mural decorations 
                <lb/>
                of his mosque &amp; palace that he put out 
                <lb/>
                the eyes of the designer in order that he 
                <lb/>
                should build no more like it. He also had
                <lb/>
                a dinner party one night to which he invited
                
                <pb n="4" facs="#rb021d" xml:id="t1-body-x7-pb1"/>
                
                the Marmelukes &amp; had them all massacred,
                <lb/>
                except one who is supposed to have jumped
                <lb/>
                his horse over the battlements and escaped,
                <lb/>
                but when one sees the jump one is inclined
                <lb/>
                to believe that if he escaped, he did not go
                <lb/>
                to the dinner. The mosque is gorgeous. We
                <lb/>
                had to put slippers on over our boots before going
                <lb/>
                in. There are 1000 lights in it, the
                <lb/>
                paintings &amp; carpets are gorgeous, there are
                <lb/>
                columns of alabaster, &amp; the echoes are wonderful.
                <lb/>
                <del rend="strike">the</del> We were afterwards shown a sort of cave
                <lb/>
                outside the walls where the better class
                <lb/>
                arabs bury their dead. It was full of
                <lb/>
                tombstones with weird engravings in Arabic.
                <lb/>
                The tomb of <name type="person" ref="#MAL"><choice><sic>Mohamed Aly</sic><corr>Muhammad Ali</corr></choice></name> is in the mosque
                <lb/>
                behind a trellis, lights are always burning
                <lb/>
                there &amp; no one can go in except the Sultan. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In the afternoon we went to the Zoo,
                <lb/>
                which is a very good one. They have some 
                <lb/>
                magnificent specimens of lions, lionesses &amp;
                <lb/>
                some dear little cubs, we <choice><sic>we</sic><corr>were</corr></choice> fortunate in
                <lb/>
                being there just at feeding time. The gardens
                <lb/>
                are well kept &amp; there are some wonderfully
                <lb/>
                made pebble mosaic paths, laid out in
                
                
                <pb n="5" facs="#rb021e" xml:id="t1-body-x8-pb1"/>
                
                patterns. There is a wonderful collection of
                <lb/>
                birds, eagles, vultures etc etc, also several <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New

            <p>
                I am enclosing some petals from a lotus
                <lb/>
                plant, which I surreptitiously picked in the 
                <lb/>
                Zoo. They are a most gorgeous red, but naturally
                <lb/>
                fade on being picked.

            <p>
                We did a ride through <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> the other
                <lb/>
                day after the proclamation of the protectorate,
                <lb/>
                and it was very interesting, we went through 
                <lb/>
                all the bad smelling parts as well as the
                <lb/>
                modern. The show is already on the cinematoscope
                <lb/>
                here, perhaps you will get it in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name>
                <lb/>
                later.

                here, as soon as possible I am going to send

                Of <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> itself I have not much to say,
                <lb/>
                it is too damned fascinating &amp; I am keeping
                <lb/>
                away as much as possible. Pinkie is well,

                I have seen him started safely on his wild

                oat career (of course without his knowledge,)
                <lb/>
                my knowledge of French gives me a pull there,
                <lb/>
                &amp; if he sticks to the same one he will be

                alright. Don't breathe a word of that to

                anyone though. 
            </p>

                Tonight I am going with <name type="person" ref="#MYN">Mayne</name> to the 
                <lb/>
                English church, don't laugh, but I want to
                <lb/>
                come in contact with some English women 
                <lb/>
                again even if it is only to see them in
                <lb/>
                church. I am tired of the eternal Egyptian,
                <lb/>
                French, Italian, Russian, Maltese, Algerian etc
                <lb/>
                etc that one sees day by day.

                <name type="person" ref="#PIN">Pinkie</name> went to see his cousin here the
                <lb/>
                other day, but he is very vague about it &amp; I 
                <lb/>
                don't think he mentioned he had a brother-in-
                <lb/>
                law here, his thoughts are on other things
                <lb/>
                at present.

                Next week we are going for a few days
                <lb/>
                hike out in the desert, it will be good
                <lb/>
                practice. I am in excellent health except
                <lb/>
                for a cold which hangs on. It is the hot
                <lb/>
                days &amp; cold nights. 
            </p>

                Blackmore is well too well in fact &amp;
                <lb/>
                I don't know what to do with him. <name type="person" ref="#ARH" key="ARH">Rhodes</name> has 
                <lb/>
                been riding him in the hoop to steady him,
                <lb/>
                but he has given up since the ride
                <lb/>
                through <name type="place" ref="#CAR" key="CAR">Cairo</name> when <name type="person" ref="#ARH" key="ARH">Rhodes</name> came home
                
                <pb n="7" facs="#rb021g" xml:id="t1-body-x16-pb1"/>
                
                completely knocked up. Even <name type="person" ref="#SLO" key="SLO">Sloan</name> recommended
                <lb/>
                me to send him to a transport wagon, as
                <lb/>
                he did not think he would ever be any good
                <lb/>
                in the troop. I have not decided yet what
                <lb/>
                to do.

                The High Commissioner arrived here yesterday,
                <lb/>
                I suppose he will be blowing about the next 
                <lb/>
                few days. Silly old politicians. This force would
                <lb/>
                be quite alright if it was not for political
                <lb/>
                influence.
