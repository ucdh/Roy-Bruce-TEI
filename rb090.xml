      <p>
        I suppose you will expect great
        <lb/>
        accounts of things in this letter but I am afraid
        <lb/>
        that after my last lengthy epistle my eloquence
        <lb/>
        has almost completely dried up - however I will
        <lb/>
        do my  best to tell what happened on the <date when="1917-01-08"><hi rend="sup"><hi rend="u">th</hi></hi></date>.
        <lb/>
        <date when="1917-01-08">On Monday afternoon the 8<hi rend="sup"><hi rend="u">th</hi></hi> <choice><abbr>Jany</abbr><expan>January</expan></choice></date> we 
        <lb/>
        pulled out of <name type="place" ref="#ARI" key="ARI">El Arish</name> to attack the Turkish positions
        <lb/>
        at <name type="place" ref="#RAF" key="RAF">Rafa</name> which is on the frontier line - Two thousand
        <lb/>
        Turks were reported there, but it there were
        <lb/>
        nearer three.  We rode <hi rend="strike">at dawn</hi>all night and the
        <lb/>
        first thing the <choice><abbr>N.Z.</abbr><expan>New Zealand</expan></choice> <choice><abbr>Bde</abbr><expan>Brigade</expan></choice> had to do at dawn was to 
        <lb/>
        round up a lot of hostile Bedouins, who lived with 
        <lb/>
        their flocks and herds just over the border.  It was a 
        <lb/>
        weird scene at day break, ghostlike and uncanny 
        <lb/>
        miles of nothing grass plains, frontier posts stretching into
        <lb/>
        the darkness, mountains on one horizon and high sand
        <lb/>
        hills and <name type="place" ref="#RAF" key="RAF">Rafa</name> four miles to the north.  The Bedouins
        <lb/>
        tents scattered broadcast, over the plains, dark shadows
        <lb/>
        of goats, sheep, donkeys, dogs and camels resting quietly on
        <lb/>
        the sheltered sides, and an<hi rend="strike">d</hi> occasional ghostlike figure
        <lb/>
        wrapped in a burnous stealing silently between the 
        <lb/>
        tents - On our approach the Bedouin cry rang out and
        
        <pb n="2" facs="#rb090b" xml:id="t1-body-x2-pb1"/>
        
        
        was taken up by every family and we heard it
        <lb/>
        carried on for miles ever fainter and fainter.
      </p>
      <p>It is a cry impossible to describe and difficult
        <lb/>
        to imitate, it is something like a, worry, worry, worry,
        <lb/>
        continued intermittently on a shrill note, and its
        <lb/>
        carrying power is remarkable.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Well, we had soon collected the Bedouins, they
        <lb/>
        did not attempt to fight, except one who shot a man
        <lb/>
        then jumped on his <add place="above">(the man's)</add>horse and got clean away.
      </p>
      
      <p>We hung round then for an hour awaiting orders 
        <lb/>
        for the general attack on <name type="place" ref="#RAF" key="RAF">Rafa</name>. Soon we heard we 
        <lb/>
        were attacking from the East, so we galloped round
        <lb/>
        to get into position - Just as we arrived word came
        <lb/>
        that a number of Turks were to be seen trying to
        <lb/>
        escape along the <choice><sic>cost</sic><corr>coast</corr></choice>, so <name type="person">the Colonel</name> sent me with
        <lb/>
        the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to cut them off and then began the most
        <lb/>
        glorious &amp; exciting ride I ever had in my life.
        <lb/>
        We galloped for 3 miles, the <hi rend="strike">four</hi> <hi rend="sup">three</hi> troops &amp; Lewis Gun
        <lb/>
        section in line one behind the other, the fourth
        <lb/>
        troop I sent ahead as a screen.  We were under 
        <lb/>
        fire nearly the whole way but only had one horse
        <lb/>
        hit - Robin nearly got another, it was funny to
        <lb/>
        see him snort, check his stride &amp; toss his head as
        <lb/>
        a bullet almost grazed his nose.  He is a grand
        <lb/>
        horse, we were going at a solid hunting pace,
        <lb/>
        he pulled the whole 3 miles, and he was always</p>
      
      <pb n="3" facs="#rb090c" xml:id="t1-body-pb2"/>
      
      <p>four lengths in front of the squadron. I don't 
        <lb/>
        think if I love to be a hundred I can ever
        <lb/>
        get another gallop like that. 3 miles over
        <lb/>
        rolling grass plains, and 60 prisoners &amp; 40 
        <lb/>
        camels and donkeys at the end of it and
        <lb/>
        we never fired a shot and only lost one
        <lb/>
        horse.  After we had done that we 
        <lb/>
        swung round dismounted and began the
        <lb/>
        attack on the Turkish redoubt 1/2 miles
        <lb/>
        away. Here the country failed us, it
        <lb/>
        was the same plains, splendid for galloping
        <lb/>
        but deadly for an advance on foot against
        <lb/>
        a cleverly concealed enemy, the ground too
        <lb/>
        all uphill in his direction. However
        <lb/>
        it had to be done and we did it, but it
        <lb/>
        took 7 hours to do that 1/2 miles!
      </p>
      <p>I got the Squadron up to 130 <choice><abbr>yds</abbr><expan>yards</expan></choice>
        <lb/>
        from the redoubt without a casualty, but 
        <lb/>
        I knew it couldn't last, and in the next 
        <lb/>
        rush the one before this final assault I
        <lb/>
        Was the first one to get it, others following
        <lb/>
        me in quick suc<hi rend="strike">c</hi>ession. I nearly howled
        <lb/>
        with rage, to have got those splendid men
        <lb/>
        so far, and then not to be able to take
        
        <pb n="4" facs="#rb090d" xml:id="t1-body-x7-pb1"/>
        
        <lb/>
        them over the top into the redoubt. However
        <lb/>
        I had had a very good day and no real
        <lb/>
        right to complain.</p>
      
      <p>The bullet that hit me was fired at
        <lb/>
        close range and was either from a revolver
        <lb/>
        or a large size rifle bullet, because where it
        <lb/>
        went in it made a hole about the size of
        <lb/>
        a two shilling piece and where it came 
        <lb/>
        out, well you could almost put a golf ball
        <lb/>
        in it. It was extraordinarily lucky, missed
        <lb/>
        the bone and all sinews and in two or
        <lb/>
        three weeks I shall never know I had it -
        <lb/>
        one sinew is laid bare, which if it had
        <lb/>
        cut would have given me a stiff leg for
        <lb/>
        ever.  I cannot understand how it
        <lb/>
        missed everything as it did, and you will
        <lb/>
        realise better when I tell you it went in to
        <lb/>
        my left leg a little above the knee on the
        <lb/>
        left <hi rend="strike">side</hi>of the leg and came out underneath.
        <lb/>
        Something like this:</p>

      </figure> 
      
      <p>Of course I went down like a ninepin. It 
        <lb/>
        felt for all the world lik a kick from a</p>
      
      <pb n="5" facs="#rb090e" xml:id="t1-body-pb3"/>
      
      <p>horse or a blow from a sledgehammer - the
        <lb/>
        unfortunate incident happened afterwards, the
        <lb/>
        two stretcher bearers who carried me away had
        <lb/>
        not gone a yard before one bullet got them
        <lb/>
        both, fracturing one man's arm and penetrating
        <lb/>
        the other one's side.  I am glad to say they
        <lb/>
        are both getting on well.</p>
      
      <p>Of the journey down to <name type="place" ref="#ARI">El Arish</name> of 30 miles
        <lb/>
        in a little cart, three of us packed in and
        <lb/>
        barely able to move I will pass over, that was
        <lb/>
        hell, but absolutely unavoidable. Then in
        <lb/>
        a hospital train from <name type="place" ref="#ARI" key="ARI">El Arish</name> to <name type="place" ref="#KAN" key="KAN">Kantara</name>, &amp;
        <lb/>
        then by steamer on the Canal to <name type="place" ref="#PRS" key="PRS">Port Said</name>,
        <lb/>
        and then to be washed &amp; put to bed between
        <lb/>
        sheets - the latter part was anything but 
        <lb/>
        hell.</p>
      
      <p>Well that is about all, here I am
        <lb/>
        living on the fat of the land, and as fit as
        <lb/>
        a buck rat, except for the fact that I can't 
        <lb/>
        get up, but I expect in a few days to get
        <lb/>
        round on one lege with a pair of crutches.</p>
      
      <p>Funny thing but I knew the day before
        <lb/>
        we moved out, and was more certain than
        <lb/>
        ever the morning of the fight that something
        <lb/>
        was going to get in my way during the day,
        <lb/>
        in fact the premonition had been there for,
        
        <pb n="6" facs="#rb090f" xml:id="t1-body-x14-pb1"/>
        
        <lb/>
        some time, the outcome of it being that
        <lb/>
        letter I wrote you about being safely provided
        <lb/>
        for.</p> 
      
      <p>Don't suppose any of your fortune telling 
        <lb/>
        crowd told you about it?</p>
      
      <p>Hope you got my cable, <name type="person" ref="#ARH" key="ARH">Arthur Rhodes</name>
        <lb/>
        sent it for me as soon as it was possible.</p>
      
      <p>One funny incident.  At the <name type="place" ref="#KAN" key="KAN">Kanhara</name> Clearing
        <lb/>
        Station our wounds were being dressed and a
        <lb/>
        Medical Corps orderley (<name type="person">Tommy</name>) who was rather
        <lb/>
        clumsily putting on a bandage, remarked "I
        <lb/>
        ain't much good at this game, sir, I'm a
        <lb/>
        butcher by trade!" Properly illustrated that 
        <lb/>
        is good enough for Punch.</p>
      
      <p>That's all for the present, news will
        <lb/>
        be pretty scarce while I am lying here, so
        <lb/>
        don't expect too much.</p>
      <closer>
        <salute>My best love to you both, and don't worry,

        I am having a very good time.</salute>
