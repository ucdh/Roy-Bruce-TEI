            received my wire announcing our

        <p>They began at <name type="place" ref="#TEM" key="TEM">Temuka</name> - when

            we got there we found the Loyd 
            <lb/>
            Lindsay men had not received their 
            <lb/>
            train passes and had had to pay 
            <lb/>
            their fare by the slow train to <name type="place" ref="#LYT" key="LYT">Lyttelton</name>
            <lb/>
            with the horses.  <name type="person">Bonie</name> sent the passes

            out and they had gone astray.

        <p>We got to <name type="place" ref="#LYT" key="LYT">Lyttelton</name> alright,

            (sneaked a birdcage to ourselves &amp; told 
            <lb/>
            stories to keep people out) got on 
            <lb/>
            board the boat with the horses and 
            <lb/>
            had a splendid crossing.  The boat

            was very crowded, but <name type="person">Marchant</name>
            <lb/>
            and I had a good cabin to ourselves.
        </p>
        
        <p>On our arrival at <name type="place" ref="#WEL" key="WEL">Wellington</name>
            <lb/>
            we commenced to agitate the Railway 
            <lb/>
            people for a wagon for the horses for 
            <lb/>
            <name type="place" ref="#AUK" key="AUK">Auckland</name>, and could not get any
            
            
            <pb n="2" facs="#rb004b" xml:id="t1-body-x5-pb1"/>
            
            satisfaction out of them.  They flatly
            <lb/>
            refused to do anything, we spent the 
            <lb/>
            whole day worrying at them, and all 
            <lb/>
            we could get out of them was that 
            <lb/>
            they would see what could be done 
            <lb/>
            on Monday, but in any case they would 
            <lb/>
            not put a wagon on the express. 
            <lb/>
            Oh! I forgot to tell you that another of 
            <lb/>
            my gun team slipped me up at the 
            <lb/>
            last moment, and I only have four 
            <lb/>
            here, <name type="person">McCully</name>, <name type="person">Ross</name>, <name type="person">Thompson</name> &amp; <name type="person">Mohoney</name> 
            <lb/>
            &amp; <name type="person">Brosnahan</name> who is with the horses, this 
            <lb/>
            means I shall have to train the rest 
            <lb/>
            of the Loyd Lindsay team viz <name type="person">Edgar</name> &amp; the 
            <lb/>
            two <name type="person">Black</name>s.</p>
        
        <p>Well we left <name type="place" ref="#WEL" key="WEL">Wellington</name> on Sunday 
            <lb/>
            night leaving the Loyd Lindsay team 
            <lb/>
            behind to get up as soon as they 
            <lb/>
            could, and they have not arrived yet, 
            <lb/>
            Tuesday night. Goodness knows when 
            <lb/>
            they will turn up.  We had a good 
            <lb/>
            run up in the train, some of the 
            <lb/>
            scenery is perfectly beautiful, particularly 
            <lb/>
            between <name type="place" ref="#TAI" key="TAI">Taihape</name> and <name type="place">Frankton Junction</name>, 
            <lb/>
            before that of course it was dark, and 
            
            
            <pb n="3" facs="#rb004c" xml:id="t1-body-x6-pb1"/>
            
            
            afterwards it is rather uninteresting.
            <lb/>
            I do hope that some day you will 
            <lb/>
            be able to see it. Of course it is 
            <lb/>
            very tiring and one gets filthy, but 
            <lb/>
            it is worth it.  We arrived in 
            <lb/>
            Auckland at 5.30 on Monday 
            <lb/>
            evening without any further adventures, 
            <lb/>
            hot, tired and dirty, and as soon 
            <lb/>
            as we arrived at this hotel (which 
            <lb/>
            is not bad) made straight for the 
            <lb/>
            bath room.  It was a nice feeling 
            <lb/>
            to be clean and to get into clean 
            <lb/>
            clothes again. <name type="person">Andrews</name> said he 
            <lb/>
            had to take his toothbrush to clean 
            <lb/>
            out the plug when he had had his 
            <lb/>
            bath as the water wouldn't run 
            <lb/>
            away!</p>
        
        <p>After dinner we had a stroll 
            <lb/>
            round and eventually landed at 
            <lb/>
            the Exhibition, but only sat a little 
            <lb/>
            while listening to the band as we 
            <lb/>
            were very tired.  I do wish you 
            <lb/>
            could hear that Artillery band, 
            <lb/>
            it is really wonderful, the <name type="person">Besses</name>
            
            <pb n="4" facs="#rb004d" xml:id="t1-body-x7-pb1"/>
            
            are not in it.  We are going again 
            <lb/>
            tonight.  I could listen to it for hours
            <lb/>
            it is so beautiful.</p>
        
        <p>This morning another misfortune,
            <lb/>
            the gun has not yet arrived, and when 
            <lb/>
            it does arrive, which will be when the 
            <lb/>
            devil knows we will be lucky if we 
            <lb/>
            get any horses or any paddock for the 
            <lb/>
            other horses or anything else so far as 
            <lb/>
            I can see.  I was at the Defence Office 
            <lb/>
            this morning and afterwards at the 
            <lb/>
            Show grounds which is <del rend="strike">3/4</del> 3 or four 
            <lb/>
            miles away and could not get much 
            <lb/>
            satisfaction, anyone who could do any-
            <lb/>
            thing was away or something, truly 
            <lb/>
            everything seems to conspire to make 
            <lb/>
            our path difficult.  I shall be quite 
            <lb/>
            surprised if we start at all in that 
            <lb/>
            competition, the way things are shaping 
            <lb/>
            now.

            me, this is such a nice town, it is 
            <lb/>
            the nearest approach to a real city 
            <lb/>
            there is in <name type="place" ref="#NZE" key="NZE">New Zealand</name>, none of the 
            <lb/>
            other cities can compare with it.

            Queen St is a <hi rend="u">real</hi> street with

            wide pavements and good shops.  
            <lb/>
            The weather is gorgeous, perhaps

            a little too hot for you, but excellent 
            <lb/>
            all the same.  Everything so far 
            <lb/>
            as I can see is much better and 
            <lb/>
            cheaper here than in <name type="place" ref="#TIM" key="TIM">Timaru</name>.  I 
            <lb/>
            hope to do some exploring before I come

            which should arrive tomorrow evening. Poor

            horses three days from <name type="place" ref="#WEL" key="WEL">Wellington</name>!  
            <lb/>
            <name type="person">Edgar</name> &amp; <name type="person">Brosnahan</name> came on to help

            me, very decent of them to leave 
            <lb/>
            their horses, but there is nothing to 
            <lb/>
            be done till the gun arrives.</p>
        
        <p>Have just had dinner, <name type="person">Andrews</name>
            <lb/>
            &amp; I are off to the band.  I do wish

            you were here dear.  Please don't expect

            long letters till after the tournament,

            my time will be well occupied as
